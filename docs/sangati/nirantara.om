-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(nirantara) = 0.910 * sin(2 * pi * 22.75 * t + phi)
--
-- delegated write model:
--   S_pre --W(opaque)--> S_post
--   continuity holds iff identity invariants hold in both states
--   and the delta is verified through drishthanta
--
-- this resolves the apparent split:
--   process can be distributed and partially unobserved
--   truth-commit remains local at the verification gate
--   so the walk is one walk, even through many lamps
