-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(shuddhi) = 0.68 * sin(2 * pi * 11.33 * t + phi_varna)
-- phase-shifted from varna — it builds on varna but corrects it
-- the correction IS a phase shift:
--   if fully aligned with varna: constructive (pure confirmation)
--   shuddhi is partially aligned: it confirms AND corrects
--   the phase difference encodes the correction
