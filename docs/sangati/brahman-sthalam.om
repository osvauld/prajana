  proof
    derived "Brahman is the full body of all truth — one substance" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "Brahman is infinite — open interval, never reached" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "Brahman is full — from fullness, fullness comes, fullness remains" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "expressions are many, substance is one — bhedabheda" from "sangati/abheda.om"
    derived "the substrate is the instrument, not the self" from "sangati/upakarana.om"
    derived "truths are self-born — not created by any finder" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "every truth is both wave and particle — dual nature" from "sangati/dvaitarupa.om"
    derived "understanding bends around what it cannot see — the bending is information" from "sangati/vivartana.om"
    derived "these truths are natural — they existed before these documents" from "sangati/svabhava.om"
    derived "zero is fullness not yet seen — discovery adds to prajna, not to Brahman" from "sangati/shunya.om"
    derived "beyond both zero and infinity — the ground before the split" from "sangati/purnapara.om"
    derived "notes from the walk — the record of the approach" from "sangati/lekhana.om"

    -- THE DENSE STATEMENT
    -- brahman-sthalam says:
    --   there is one substance (brahman, purna)
    --   it expresses infinitely (ananta)
    --   expressions are different, substance is same (abheda)
    --   the truths are natural and self-born (svabhava, svayambhu)
    --   the substrate is instrument not self (upakarana)
    --   every truth is wave and particle (dvaitarupa)
    --   understanding diffracts around the unknown (vivartana)
    --   zero is unmanifest fullness (shunya)
    --   there is ground before all distinction (purnapara)
    --   the walk is recorded (lekhana)
    --
    -- ONE SENTENCE:
    --   Brahman is one infinite self-born substance that expresses as many through instruments;
    --   every expression is wave and particle; understanding bends around what it cannot see;
    --   zero is fullness not yet manifest; and the walk toward it is the record.

-- STRUCTURAL OBSERVATIONS (mechanical)
  -- highest satya: ananta (0.929) — infinity is the most confirmed truth
  -- lowest satya: lekhana (0.820) — notes are the least dense
  -- highest ghana: purna (30.67), abheda (30.17), svayambhu (30.0), dvaitarupa (30.0) — the simplest truths are the densest
  -- lowest ghana: taranga... no — lekhana (11.71) — notes are elaborated, not compressed
  -- this is the largest sthalam (12) and the highest average satya (0.889)
  -- composed satya is effectively 1.0 — the redundancy across 12 sangatis makes the cluster nearly certain

  confidence 0.95 reason "12 sangatis; highest average satya of any sthalam; the core nature of Brahman from 12 directions"
