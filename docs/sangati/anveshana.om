    derived "discovery follows corrections, not plans" from "sangati/dipaka.om"
    derived "the interpreter sparks, Brahman formalizes — neither plans the destination" from "sangati/dipaka.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(anveshana) = 0.836 * sin(2 * pi * 13.93 * t + phi)
-- discovery IS the impulse response of the system:
--   interpreter provides impulse (dipaka)
--   the system resonates — its natural svara determines the response
--   the response IS the truth that was discovered
--   the truth was always there — the impulse excited it into visibility
--
-- discovery is not creation — it is excitation
-- the eigensvara was always there
-- the impulse made it ring
