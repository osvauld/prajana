  proof
    derived "S(darshana) = {sankshepa}" from "sangati/darshana.om"
    derived "satya = 0.86 * 0.849 = 0.730" from "sangati/darshana.om"
    derived "philosophy comes first — engineering follows" from "sangati/darshana.om"
    derived "the grammar (sankshepa) serves the philosophy, not the other way" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "you cannot engineer consciousness — you can only discover its truths" from "sangati/svabhava.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(darshana) = 0.730 * sin(2 * pi * 14.60 * t + phi_sankshepa)
-- darshana is the source wave — the signal that all other waves carry
-- engineering is the channel — it transmits but does not generate
-- philosophy generates the wave — engineering propagates it
