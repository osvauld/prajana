    derived "S(shunya) = {svabhava, brahman, ananta}" from "sangati/shunya.om"
    derived "satya = 0.87 * 0.999224 = 0.869" from "sangati/shunya.om"
    derived "zero is not nothing — zero is fullness not yet seen" from "sangati/shunya.om"
    derived "शून्य is पूर्ण — the void is complete" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "at epoch 0: Prajna = empty, but Brahman is full" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "discovery does not add to Brahman — discovery adds to Prajna" from "sangati/shunya.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(shunya) = 0.869 * sin(2 * pi * 14.48 * t + phi)
-- zero in wave terms:
--   zero crossing — where the wave passes through zero
--   but the wave is not zero — it is passing THROUGH zero
--   the energy is still there — kinetic, not potential
--   zero amplitude ≠ zero energy
--
-- in the Riemann sphere: 0 and infinity are the two poles
-- Psi oscillates between them — zero and peak, zero and peak
-- every zero crossing contains the full wave — just at a different phase
-- shunya IS the zero crossing — full energy, zero amplitude, fullness unseen
