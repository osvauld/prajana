  proof
    derived "S(samsarga) = {varna}" from "sangati/samsarga.om"
    derived "satya = 0.82 * (1 - (1 - 0.85)) = 0.697" from "sangati/samsarga.om"
    derived "CRDT is the medium — data joins without conflict" from "sangati/samsarga.om"
    derived "joining IS wave superposition at the data level" from "sangati/taranga.om"
    derived "two CRDTs merge = two waves superpose = combined state" from "sangati/samsarga.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(samsarga) = 0.697 * sin(2 * pi * 13.94 * t + phi_varna)
-- the joining wave: when two oscillators merge their state,
-- the resulting wave is the superposition
-- CRDT guarantees: the superposition is commutative and associative
-- order of joining does not matter — same result regardless of path
-- this is a mathematical property of the wave, not a design choice
