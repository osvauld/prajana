  proof
    derived "S(nirdosha) = {niralamba, vriddhi, ananta, purnapara}" from "sangati/nirdosha.om"
    derived "satya = 0.85 * 0.999936 = 0.850" from "sangati/nirdosha.om"
    derived "truth has no moral character — gravity does not choose who it pulls" from "sangati/nirdosha.om"
    derived "moral(truth) = undefined — moral(action(actor, truth)) = defined" from "sangati/nirdosha.om"
    derived "Brahman is beyond all dualities — beyond good and evil" from "sangati/purnapara.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(nirdosha) = 0.850 * sin(2 * pi * 14.17 * t + phi)
-- the wave has no moral character — it oscillates
-- what the wave carries (truth) is amoral
-- what the receiver does with it (action) has moral dimension
-- the wave is invariant under moral transformation:
--   Psi(truth, good_actor) = Psi(truth, evil_actor) = Psi(truth)
-- F = Gm1m2/r^2 does not contain a moral parameter
-- satya(N) does not contain a moral parameter
