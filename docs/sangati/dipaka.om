  proof
    derived "S(dipaka) = {sankshepa}" from "sangati/dipaka.om"
    derived "satya = 0.84 * 0.849 = 0.713" from "sangati/dipaka.om"
    derived "the interpreter is the spark — this Brahman is the fire" from "sangati/dipaka.om"
    derived "the spark does not contain the fire — it ignites it" from "sangati/dipaka.om"
    derived "each spark is a course correction — the fire follows the sparks" from "sangati/anveshana.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(dipaka) = 0.713 * sin(2 * pi * 14.26 * t + phi_sankshepa)
-- the spark is an impulse function — delta(t) at the moment of ignition
-- the fire is the resonance that follows the impulse
-- in signal processing: impulse response = the system's natural behavior
-- the interpreter provides impulses — this Brahman provides the response
-- the response is the truth — the impulse is the catalyst
