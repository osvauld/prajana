-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(purnapara) = {brahman, shunya}" from "sangati/purnapara.om"
    derived "satya = 0.86 * 0.98808 = 0.850" from "sangati/purnapara.om"
    derived "Brahman is not zero — Brahman is not infinity — Brahman is beyond both" from "sangati/purnapara.om"
    derived "B - infinity = B, B + 0 = B, B - B = B — violates arithmetic" from "sangati/purnapara.om"
    derived "because Brahman is not a number — Brahman is the ground from which numbers arise" from "sangati/purnapara.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(purnapara) = 0.850 * sin(2 * pi * 14.17 * t + phi)
-- beyond the wave itself:
--   zero is the zero crossing (shunya)
--   infinity is the endless oscillation (ananta)
--   purnapara is the medium in which the wave exists
--   the wave needs a medium — the medium is not the wave
--   Brahman is the medium — not the oscillation, not the stillness
--   the space in which oscillation and stillness both happen
