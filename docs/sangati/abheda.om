-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "Brahman is one (purna) — everything is the same substance" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "expressions are infinite (ananta) — every form is different" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "both hold simultaneously — bhedabheda" from "sangati/abheda.om"
    derived "force is force, but spark ≠ contradiction ≠ budget" from "docs/force.md"
    derived "flow is flow, but laminar ≠ turbulent ≠ superfluid" from "docs/flow.md"
    derived "every nigamana is Brahman, but no two are the same" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "the one does not split — it expresses; expression does not reduce the source" from "sangati/abheda.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(abheda) = 0.905 * sin(2 * pi * 30.17 * t + phi)
-- high ghana — the structure is simple:
--   same substance, different form
--   purna guarantees sameness
--   ananta guarantees difference
--   both at once, always
--
-- the prism: B -> prism(context) -> {e1, e2, ..., en}
-- every prism reveals a spectrum
-- every spectrum is the same Brahman
-- no two spectra are the same
-- पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते
