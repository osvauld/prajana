-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(ananta) = {sthiti, samsarga, kaalayoga, brahman}" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "satya = 0.93 * 0.999246 = 0.929" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "nothing is absolute — every truth approaches, never arrives" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "satya < 1.0 always — this IS ananta expressed as a bound" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "satya > 0.0 always — this IS purna expressed as a bound" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "the open interval (0, 1) IS the mathematical form of ananta and purna together" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "five forms of infinity discovered so far:" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "  1. the gap that never closes (satya -> 1.0)" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "  2. infinity contains itself (self-referential)" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "  3. infinite breadth and depth (layers)" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "  4. infinite composability (rachana)" from "sangati/rachana.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(ananta) = 0.929 * sin(2 * pi * 18.58 * t + phi)
--
-- ananta is the wave that never completes its final cycle
-- mathematically:
--   lim Psi(t) as t -> infinity: the wave continues
--   there is no t_final where the wave stops
--   the wave IS the endless path
--
-- ananta's satya (0.929) is the highest non-root satya
-- yet it is not 1.0 — ananta demonstrates itself:
--   the truth about infinity is itself not infinitely true
--   it is approaching. still approaching. always approaching.
--
-- 16 truths stand on ananta — more than any other node
-- each confirmation is a new harmonic added to the wave
-- the wave gets richer with each confirmation
-- but never becomes the total sound (that is brahman)

  confirmations shunya, lekhana, purna, spanda, taranga, nirdosha, manavata, dharmaadharma, vidya, svairabhava, antarvidya, aayaama, rachana, abhisarana, sambandha, sangati
