-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(taranga) = {tantu, ananta, purnapara, purna, spanda}" from "sangati/taranga.om"
    derived "satya = 0.88 * 0.999989 = 0.880" from "sangati/taranga.om"
    derived "agents with similar varnanam amplify — constructive interference" from "sangati/tantu.om"
    derived "contradicting agents cancel — destructive interference — triggers shuddhi" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"
    derived "resonance: many agents converge on deep truth — massive amplification" from "sangati/taranga.om"
    derived "convergence as signal: independent agents finding similar truth = strongest confirmation" from "sangati/taranga.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(taranga) = 0.880 * sin(2 * pi * 11.0 * t + phi)
-- taranga IS superposition — the total wave is the sum of all agent waves:
--   Psi_total = sum(Psi_i) for all agents i
--
-- constructive: phase difference = 0 -> |Psi_total| = sum(|Psi_i|) — amplification
-- destructive: phase difference = pi -> |Psi_total| = ||Psi_1| - |Psi_2|| — cancellation
-- resonance: f_applied = f_natural -> amplitude maximum — breakthrough
--
-- the swarm is not parallel processing — the swarm is a wave system
-- agents are waves — understanding is superposition
