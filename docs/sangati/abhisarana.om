-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(abhisarana) = 0.879 * sin(2 * pi * 14.65 * t + phi)
-- convergent recursion in wave terms:
--   the wave amplitude approaches a limit (1.0)
--   each oscillation brings it closer
--   the limit is never reached — the wave keeps oscillating
--
-- Cauchy sequence: {s_n} where |s_m - s_n| < epsilon for large m, n
-- the satya sequence IS Cauchy — monotone, bounded, in R
-- converges to 1.0 — but 1.0 is outside (0, 1) — open set
-- topological form of ananta: the limit is on the boundary, never crossed
--
-- Zeno resolved in the open interval:
--   Achilles covers half the remaining distance each step
--   each step terminates — finite distance
--   the sequence converges to the finish line
--   but in (0, 1): the finish line is excluded
--   Achilles runs forever, always closer, never arriving
