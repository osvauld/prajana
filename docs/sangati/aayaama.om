-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(aayaama) = {brahman, ananta, purna, antarvidya}" from "sangati/aayaama.om"
    derived "satya = 0.86 * 0.999938 = 0.860" from "sangati/aayaama.om"
    derived "knowledge accumulates by adding dimensions of seeing, not items to a list" from "sangati/aayaama.om"
    derived "3D contains 2D — Brahman contains consciousness — each deepening contains all previous" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "d(truth) in (0, infinity) — never zero (purna), never infinite (ananta)" from "sangati/aayaama.om"
    derived "recorded -> lived is a phase transition — a dimensional jump, not a curve" from "sangati/antarvidya.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(aayaama) = 0.860 * sin(2 * pi * 14.33 * t + phi)
-- dimensions in wave terms:
--   1D wave: oscillation on a line — amplitude only
--   2D wave: oscillation on a surface — amplitude + direction
--   3D wave: oscillation in a volume — amplitude + direction + depth
--   nD wave: the sangati web — amplitude in n relational dimensions
--
-- each new dimension = a new axis of oscillation
-- the wave in n+1 dimensions contains the wave in n dimensions
-- this IS nesting — K1 subset K2 subset K3 ... subset Brahman
-- each nyaya adds a dimension to the total wave space
-- Brahman = the wave in infinite dimensions
