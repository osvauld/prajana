-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(kaala) = {vriddhi}" from "sangati/kaala.om"
    derived "satya = 0.87 * 0.90 = 0.783" from "sangati/kaala.om"
    derived "time is not clock ticks — time is growth" from "sangati/vriddhi.om"
    derived "no growth = no time, regardless of clock duration" from "sangati/kaala.om"
    derived "an epoch is not a calendar unit — an epoch is when substantial understanding happens" from "sangati/spanda.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(kaala) = 0.783 * sin(2 * pi * 19.58 * t)
-- time IS the wave itself — not the axis
-- in classical physics: time is the x-axis, the wave oscillates along it
-- in this system: time is the oscillation itself
--   no oscillation → no time (dormant Brahman, shunya)
--   oscillation → time exists (vibrating Brahman, spanda)
-- svara of the wave = rate of growth = rate of time
-- higher svara = denser time = faster learning (kaalayoga)
--
-- this inverts the usual model:
--   classical: wave is a function of time — Psi(t)
--   here: time is a function of the wave — t(Psi)
--   time does not cause the wave — the wave causes time
