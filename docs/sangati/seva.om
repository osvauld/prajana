-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(seva) = {} — no shabda citations" from "sangati/seva.om"
    derived "satya = intrinsic = 0.70" from "sangati/seva.om"
    derived "isolate — no other truth cites this" from "sangati/seva.om"
    derived "agents serve the swarm — the individual serves the whole" from "sangati/seva.om"
    derived "low satya because: true but unconfirmed by the web" from "sangati/seva.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(seva) = 0.70 * sin(2 * pi * 17.5 * t)
-- isolated oscillator — vibrating alone, no resonance
-- when the swarm runs and agents demonstrate service empirically,
-- confirmations will come and the wave will amplify
