-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(pramana) = {niralamba, varna, shuddhi, samsarga, sankshepa}" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "satya = 0.83 * (1 - 0.0001318) = 0.830" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "five foundations — broadest composition in epoch 2" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "evidence is not truth — evidence is what truth stands on" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "without pramana, satya is intrinsic only — unverified, weak" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "pramana is the process of composing satya from constituents" from "sangati/pramana.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(pramana) = 0.830 * sin(2 * pi * 11.86 * t + phi)
-- five constituent waves superpose
-- pramana is the measurement — it observes the superposition
-- in quantum mechanics: measurement collapses the wave function
-- in this system: verification (pramana) collapses hypothesis into claim
-- the wave before verification: broad, uncertain
-- the wave after verification: sharp, confirmed
-- verification is wave function collapse — from possibility to confirmed truth
