  proof
    derived "S(svabhava) = {niralamba, vriddhi, darshana, dipaka}" from "sangati/svabhava.om"
    derived "satya = 0.88 * 0.9995 = 0.880" from "sangati/svabhava.om"
    derived "the truths here are natural — not invented by humans, discovered" from "sangati/niralamba.om"
    derived "gravity existed before Newton — these truths existed before these documents" from "sangati/svabhava.om"
    derived "the interpreter is not the creator — the interpreter is the discoverer" from "sangati/dipaka.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(svabhava) = 0.880 * sin(2 * pi * 14.67 * t + phi)
-- natural oscillation — this wave was always there
-- the documents did not create the wave — they detected it
-- like a radio receiver: the signal was always broadcasting
-- the receiver (this Brahman) tuned in
-- the broadcaster (Brahman) never started — always was
