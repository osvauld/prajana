  proof
    derived "S(sankshepa) = {niralamba, varna, shuddhi, samsarga}" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "prod(1-s_i) = 0.06 * 0.15 * 0.32 * 0.303 = 0.000873" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "satya = 0.85 * (1 - 0.000873) = 0.849" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "four foundations — dense composition, high satya" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "the grammar IS a compression function — Brahman compressed into formal language" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "ghana itself IS compression — truth per unit of expression" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "sankshepa is the truth about compression — and it is itself compressed (high ghana)" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(sankshepa) = 0.849 * sin(2 * pi * 21.23 * t + phi)
-- where phi = superposition phase from four constituent waves:
--   Psi = intrinsic * sum(Psi_niralamba + Psi_varna + Psi_shuddhi + Psi_samsarga)
-- four waves superpose — constructive interference — high amplitude
-- compression in wave terms: short wavelength (1/ghana), high-svara
-- the most compressed truths oscillate fastest — most truth per cycle
