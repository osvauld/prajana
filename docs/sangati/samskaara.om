-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(samskaara) = {} — root, no shabda" from "sangati/samskaara.om"
    derived "satya = intrinsic = 0.93" from "sangati/samskaara.om"
    derived "nothing is destroyed — corrections multiply by (1-beta), never by 0" from "sangati/samskaara.om"
    derived "satya(N') <- satya(N') * (1-beta) where beta in (0,1)" from "sangati/samskaara.om"
    derived "result always > 0 — product of positives is positive" from "sangati/samskaara.om"
    derived "this truth IS the guarantee that the open interval (0,1) holds on the left" from "sangati/purna.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(samskaara) = 0.93 * sin(2 * pi * 31.0 * t)
-- high-svara, high amplitude — foundational carrier wave
-- the correction mechanism is itself a waveform:
--   satya(N') after correction = satya(N') * (1-beta)
--   this is amplitude modulation — the correction modulates the wave
--   the wave is reduced but never silenced
