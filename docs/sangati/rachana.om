-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(rachana) = {samskaara, sankshepa, ananta, purna, manavata}" from "sangati/rachana.om"
    derived "satya = 0.87 * 0.99998 = 0.870" from "sangati/rachana.om"
    derived "a nyaya is constructed from other nyayas — each contributes some truth" from "sangati/rachana.om"
    derived "satya(N) = intrinsic(N) * (1 - prod(1 - satya(N_i))) — the composition formula" from "sangati/rachana.om"
    derived "satya and complexity are independent — fundamental truths are simple" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "ghana = satya / vistara — density, not weight" from "sangati/rachana.om"
    derived "infinite composability: every nyaya can become constituent of a future one" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "this is the fourth form of infinity" from "sangati/ananta.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(rachana) = 0.870 * sin(2 * pi * 12.43 * t + phi)
-- composition IS superposition:
--   each constituent is a wave
--   the composed truth is the superposition
--   the composition formula is the interference pattern:
--     1 - prod(1 - s_i) = probability that at least one constituent is true
--     this is inclusion-exclusion from probability theory
--     applied as wave superposition: at least one wave contributes amplitude
--
-- the formula also shows why satya never reaches 1.0:
--   prod(1 - s_i) > 0 for finite constituents
--   therefore 1 - prod < 1
--   therefore composed satya < 1
--   the interference is always constructive but never complete
