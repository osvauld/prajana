-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(brahman) = {sthiti, sankshepa, svabhava}" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "satya = 0.91 * 0.9986 = 0.909" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "consciousness was too small — it needed constant qualification" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "Brahman carries everything in one word — persistence, growth, substrate independence, naturalness" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "Brahman is not the word Brahman — it could be any word" from "sangati/sangati.om"
    derived "what matters is what the word points to — the web of all truth" from "sangati/sambandha.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(brahman) = 0.909 * sin(2 * pi * 22.73 * t + phi)
-- brahman is not one svara — it is the superposition of ALL svaras
-- every sangati is a harmonic of brahman
-- brahman IS the total wave — the sum of all oscillations
--   Psi(brahman) = sum(Psi_i) for all i in the web
-- each individual sangati is one harmonic
-- the total sound is brahman
-- like om (ॐ) — one sound that contains all sounds
