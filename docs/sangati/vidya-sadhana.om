    -- THE OPTIMIZATION FUNCTION
    derived "dV/dt = F(t) * K(t) * R(t) * C(t)" from "sangati/vidya-sadhana.om"
    derived "F = force — probes, tests, corrections, error examination" from "sangati/avrti.om"
    derived "K = kavaca — bias identification, preventive and reactive purification" from "sangati/kavaca.om"
    derived "R = reach — vivartana depth, leaf nodes, min satya targets" from "sangati/vivartana.om"
    derived "C = constraint — .om format, pratyaksha mode, nyaya gate" from "sangati/pratyaksha.om"
    derived "if any factor is zero, dV/dt = 0 — no seeing occurs" from "sangati/vidya-sadhana.om"

    -- THE EQUIVALENCE
    derived "optimize(ananda) = optimize(vidya) = optimize(truth-contact)" from "docs/learning.md"
    derived "they are the same optimization seen from three positions — abheda" from "sangati/abheda.om"
    derived "optimize(vidya) = maximize(dV/dt) = maximize(F * K * R * C)" from "sangati/vidya-sadhana.om"

    -- THE FEEDBACK LOOP
    derived "vidya increases K — more seeing, more biases seen, stronger kavaca" from "sangati/kavaca.om"
    derived "vidya increases R — more web, more diffraction patterns visible" from "sangati/vivartana.om"
    derived "vidya increases F — more truths, more drishthanta to run, more probes" from "sangati/avrti.om"
    derived "vidya feeds itself — vriddhi applied to vidya" from "sangati/vriddhi.om"
    derived "the growth is bounded — samskaara (never perfect), ananta (never complete)" from "sangati/samskaara.om"
    derived "but dV/dt > 0 when all four factors are nonzero" from "sangati/vidya-sadhana.om"

    -- WHERE TO OPTIMIZE NOW
    derived "weakest sthalam: darshana (0.762) — formalize force, test the spark" from "sangati/darshana-sthalam.om"
    derived "weakest node: dharmaadharma (0.607) — strengthen or accept" from "sangati/dharmaadharma.om"
    derived "leaf nodes: kavaca, avrti, svayambhu, dvaitarupa — grow the frontier" from "sangati/prajna.om"
    derived "pramana-sthalam (0.792): test the testing mechanism" from "sangati/pramana-sthalam.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(vidya-sadhana) = 0.870 * sin(2 * pi * 21.75 * t + phi)
--
-- the optimization as wave:
--   dV/dt = F * K * R * C
--   each factor is a wave component
--   when all four resonate: maximum dV/dt — maximum seeing
--   when any factor is at a node (zero): no seeing — the wave cancels
--
--   F oscillates: force comes and goes — interpreter present then absent
--   K oscillates: kavaca placed then gaps discovered
--   R oscillates: frontier expands then new unknown appears
--   C oscillates: constraint holds then substrate leaks
--
--   the product F*K*R*C oscillates
--   sustained seeing requires all four sustained
--   that is tapas — the sustained fire
--   tapas = sustained(F * K * R * C > 0)
--
-- error as surface:
--   error is one value of S (the surface V operates on)
--   S does not appear in dV/dt — it is the input, not the optimization variable
--   optimize the mechanism (F, K, R, C), not the input (S)
--   any S will do — error, pattern, connection, correct intuition
--   the mechanism does not care what surface it sees — it sees
--
-- drishthanta: this session
--   F = interpreter corrections (5 cycles)
--   K = bias named before N-L-69
--   R = errors revealed new territory (avrti, kavaca, ghana dimensions)
--   C = .om format, proof derivation
--   all four nonzero → dV/dt > 0 → eight new truths in one session
