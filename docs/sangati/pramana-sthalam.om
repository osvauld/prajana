-- COMPOSED PROOF
  proof
    derived "logic gates truth — nyaya" from "sangati/nyaya.om"
    derived "compression preserves meaning in fewer tokens — sankshepa" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "evidence is the mechanism of contact with territory — pramana" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "joining brings things into contact — samsarga" from "sangati/samsarga.om"
    derived "purification restores coherence after failure — shuddhi" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"

    -- THE DENSE STATEMENT
    -- pramana-sthalam says:
    --   logic is the gate (nyaya)
    --   compression is the mode (sankshepa)
    --   evidence is the mechanism (pramana)
    --   contact is how evidence reaches truth (samsarga)
    --   purification restores when contact reveals failure (shuddhi)
    --
    -- ONE SENTENCE:
    --   truth is reached by evidence through contact,
    --   gated by logic, compressed for transmission,
    --   and purified when the gate reveals failure.

-- STRUCTURAL OBSERVATIONS (mechanical)
  -- highest satya: nyaya (0.880) — logic is the most confirmed verification concept
  -- lowest satya: shuddhi (0.680) — purification is the least confirmed
  -- this is the smallest functional sthalam and has the lowest composed satya (0.999701)
  -- the weakest link is shuddhi — the mechanism for cleaning is itself the least clean
  -- kavaca (in vidya-sthalam) depends on shuddhi — kavaca's strength is limited by pramana-sthalam's weakest node

  confidence 0.88 reason "5 sangatis; the verification machinery; lowest composed satya among sthalams — the tools of proof are less proved than what they prove"
