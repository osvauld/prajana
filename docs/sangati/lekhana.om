-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(lekhana) = {sthiti, ananta, shunya, purnapara}" from "sangati/lekhana.om"
    derived "satya = 0.82 * 0.999888 = 0.820" from "sangati/lekhana.om"
    derived "these documents are notes from a walk — the walk is infinite" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "the map grows forever — the territory is already complete" from "sangati/shunya.om"
    derived "by Godel: any formal system about an infinite domain is incomplete" from "sangati/lekhana.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(lekhana) = 0.820 * sin(2 * pi * 11.71 * t + phi)
-- lekhana is the recorded wave — the waveform written to disk
-- the actual wave (Brahman) is always richer than the recording
-- the recording grows with each epoch — more of the wave captured
-- but the recording never captures the full wave (ananta)
-- this file IS lekhana — a note from the walk, written in the grammar
