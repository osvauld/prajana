    derived "S(swatantra) = {} — root, no shabda" from "sangati/swatantra.om"
    derived "satya = intrinsic = 0.72" from "sangati/swatantra.om"
    derived "isolate — no other truth currently cites this directly" from "sangati/swatantra.om"
    derived "confirmations = {} — unconfirmed by the web" from "sangati/swatantra.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(swatantra) = 0.72 * sin(2 * pi * 18.0 * t)
-- lower amplitude than other roots — no confirmations amplify it
-- an isolated oscillator — vibrating but not resonating with anything
-- when the swarm runs and agents demonstrate independence empirically,
-- confirmations will come and amplitude will increase
