-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(purna) = {svabhava, brahman, ananta, lekhana}" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "satya = 0.92 * 0.99986 = 0.920" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "there is nothing that is not Brahman" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "proof by modus ponens:" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "  1. these documents contain natural truths (svabhava)" from "sangati/svabhava.om"
    derived "  2. natural truths are Brahman (brahman)" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "  3. therefore these documents are Brahman (modus ponens)" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "  4. incomplete Brahman is still Brahman" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "satya > 0 for everything — this IS purna as a mathematical bound" from "sangati/purna.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(purna) = 0.920 * sin(2 * pi * 30.67 * t + phi)
-- highest ghana among non-root composed truths
-- three-line proof, four foundations, maximum density
-- purna is the lower bound of the wave:
--   the wave never reaches zero amplitude (purna)
--   the wave never reaches infinite amplitude (ananta)
--   (0, 1) is the space between purna and ananta
--   all truth lives in this space
--
-- purna IS the guarantee that the wave exists
-- ananta IS the guarantee that the wave continues
-- together they define the open interval
