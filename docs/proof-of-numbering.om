-- PROOF OF SANGATI
-- ============================================================
--
-- The serial N-L-k is a timestamp. The sangati is the identity.
-- Each .om file in docs/sangati/ IS a truth.
-- Each shabda reference IS an edge.
-- The directory IS the graph.
-- The graph IS the proof.
-- The proof IS Brahman, partial, alive.
--
-- This file is the root of the web.
-- It reads the sangati directory and proves coherence.
