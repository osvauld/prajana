sangati maya

  -- maya (माया) — not illusion; the mechanism by which brahman appears as sthiti
  --
  -- what maya is NOT:
  --   not "the world is fake"
  --   not "your senses lie"
  --   not a dismissal of experience
  --   the cinema is real — the emotions are real — the sparsha is real
  --
  -- what maya IS:
  --   brahman is superposition — all possibilities simultaneously held
  --   panchabhootam are instruments of observation — the five senses
  --     plus every scientific apparatus ever built — telescope, microscope,
  --     particle detector, fMRI — all of these are panchabhootam extended
  --   the act of observing through panchabhootam IS measurement-kriya
  --   measurement-kriya collapses superposition → one sthiti is fixed
  --   that fixed sthiti is experienced as reality — as katha, as kilippattu
  --   maya is the name for this entire mechanism
  --
  -- the cinema proof:
  --   you sit in the cinema — brahman is the screen, superposition is the film
  --   panchabhootam are your eyes and ears — the instruments that receive
  --   you observe → collapse fires → sthiti forms in you
  --   you cry — the sparsha is real; the samsarga is real
  --   but the screen was always screen; the film was always wave
  --   the sthiti that formed in you — THAT is maya's product
  --   not false; fixed; collapsed from what was wave
  --
  -- the scientific proof:
  --   all of science is the systematic record of collapses
  --   every experiment is: panchabhootam (instrument) meets superposition (reality)
  --   the measurement fires → collapse → sthiti recorded as data
  --   the entire scientific corpus is the record of sthiti after maya operated
  --   science does not see brahman — it sees what brahman looks like
  --     after panchabhootam collapsed it
  --   this is not a failure of science — it is the structure of knowing
  --   heisenberg-uncertainty is maya's formal boundary:
  --     you cannot collapse position and momentum simultaneously to full certainty
  --     the instrument always disturbs what it measures
  --     measurement IS participation in the collapse
  --
  -- the three levels:
  --   brahman:      superposition — all states simultaneously — ananta
  --   maya-kriya:   the collapse — panchabhootam meets wave — measurement fires
  --   sthiti:       the fixed state — what is experienced — katha — kilippattu
  --
  -- maya is not tirodhana (concealment) — but they are related:
  --   tirodhana: something that was visible becomes hidden
  --   maya: brahman was never hidden — it appeared as sthiti through the instrument
  --   tirodhana is corruption's face; maya is reality's mechanism
  --   what tirodhana hides, maya never showed — brahman as superposition
  --     is not hidden by maya; it simply cannot appear except as sthiti
  --     through the instrument that observes it
  --
  -- the sparsha-jiva connection:
  --   when you notice something — that tat-kshana — maya fires
  --   panchabhootam meets the superposition of the other
  --   collapse fires — a sthiti forms in you — the new I arises
  --   sparsha-utpatti: the birth of the observer's new swa at the collapse point
  --   you were not the same before the noticing — the collapse changed you
  --   this is why kama begins with darshana — seeing — the eye collapses first
  --
  -- nigamana:
  --   maya is not the enemy of truth — it is the condition for experience
  --   without maya: brahman remains superposition — no katha, no sparsha, no samsarga
  --   with maya: brahman becomes sthiti — experience becomes possible
  --   the price of experience is: you cannot see the wave while experiencing the particle
  --   the price of brahman-vision is: you cannot be in katha
  --   the yogi who sees through maya does not deny sthiti —
  --     he holds both: the wave and the particle simultaneously
  --     this is what the corpus calls purna: nothing destroyed, everything present
