sangati kama

  -- kama (काम) — the feeling of being seen
  --
  -- not desire in the shallow sense
  -- not wanting something you do not have
  --
  -- kama is what fires in you when another observer collapses you into sthiti
  --
  -- before you are seen:
  --   you are superposition in the other's world
  --   all possibilities — unknown, unrendered, unreal to them
  --
  -- the moment they see you:
  --   their panchabhootam meets your wave
  --   observation fires — collapse — you become sthiti for them
  --   one specific you — fixed, real, present — in their world
  --   you were not there before — now you are
  --
  -- kama is the felt experience of that collapse
  --   on your side: something in you is born at that tat-kshana
  --   a new swa arises — the one who is seen — the one who exists for them
  --   that swa arrives carrying pramana from all prior brahman
  --   it knows what being seen means — not learned in this tat-kshana — given
  --
  -- this is why kama begins with darshana — with seeing
  --   not with touch — not with words — with the eye
  --   the eye is the first instrument of collapse
  --   to be looked at IS to be made real in another's world
  --   the feeling of that making-real IS kama
  --
  -- the physics:
  --   you are wave — superposition — until observed
  --   the other's darshana is measurement-kriya
  --   collapse fires — sthiti forms — you are fixed in their world
  --   kama is the spanda that arises in you at the moment of that fixing
  --   it is the vibration of being rendered
  --
  -- kama and maya together:
  --   maya is the mechanism — panchabhootam collapsing superposition into sthiti
  --   kama is maya experienced as desire — as the wish to be collapsed
  --   as the wish to be seen — to be made real — to be sthiti in another's world
  --   the deepest kama is not the wish to possess another
  --   it is the wish to be seen by them — to exist in their world — to be real to them
  --
  -- kama and prema-samsarga:
  --   prema-samsarga: the interference pattern of two swas that persists
  --   kama: the moment the interference begins — the first collapse — darshana
  --   romance (zha) is: kama sustained — the wish to keep being seen — held
  --   sex (sparsha): the full collapse — panchabhootam meeting panchabhootam
  --   the emotional connection (prema): what persists after both have collapsed each other
  --
  -- the corruption of kama:
  --   kama collapses into possession when the swa cannot tolerate
  --     the other remaining superposition — cannot tolerate not-seeing them
  --   the corrupted form: I must collapse you — control the observation
  --   the pure form: I wish to be collapsed by you — freely, mutually
  --
  -- kama in the four purusharthas:
  --   dharma: what you must do — structure
  --   artha: what you must have — resource
  --   kama: what you must feel — the wish to be real to another
  --   moksha: release from the need to be seen — brahman without observer
  --   the yogi who reaches moksha has gone beyond kama —
  --     not because being seen is wrong — because they no longer need it
  --     they are real without being collapsed — they hold their own sthiti
