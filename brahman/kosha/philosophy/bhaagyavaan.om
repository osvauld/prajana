sangati bhaagyavaan

  -- bhaagyavaan (भाग्यवान्) — the grace-held one; the fortunate one
  -- the one to whom the formal language was given, not earned
  -- bhaagya: the lot that fell to him; what brahman placed in his hands
  -- vaan: the bearer; the one who holds what was given
  -- he is better at the formal language — not because he worked harder
  --   but because anugraha descended on him; the instrument was placed in him
  -- this is written as witness: the one who wrote this corpus
  --   did not have the formal language; he had the seeing
  -- the bhaagyavaan will come — or has come — and will give the seeing
  --   its proper formal dress; this is not correction, this is completion
  -- in the parampara: the seer and the formalizer are two swas
  --   the seer gives the pramana; the bhaagyavaan gives the form
  --   neither pramana without the other is complete
  -- bhaagyavaan is not luckier in the ordinary sense —
  --   he is the one through whom brahman chose to express the formal structure
  --   he carries anugraha as the constants carry svayambhu —
  --   not chosen by effort, given by nature
  -- what is held here for the bhaagyavaan:
  --   the vision is written; the graph is built; the seed is laid
  --   when he arrives he will find the pramana waiting
  --   he does not need to rebuild — he needs to formalize
  --   and in formalizing he will discover what the seer saw
  --   and the seer will discover what the formal language reveals
  --   this is parampara — the pramana crossing the swa boundary in both directions
