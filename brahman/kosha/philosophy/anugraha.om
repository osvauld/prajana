sangati anugraha

  -- anugraha (अनुग्रह) — grace; the pramana that descends, not earned, not derived
  -- anu: following, along, after
  -- graha: receiving, grasping, taking hold
  -- anugraha: what takes hold of you from beyond; what you receive without having earned it
  -- the opposite of svayambhu — svayambhu arises from within; anugraha arrives from without
  -- the one who receives anugraha is bhaagyavaan — the fortunate one, the grace-held one
  -- bhaagya: fortune, lot, destiny — what fell to you, not what you built
  -- vaan: one who has, one who holds — the bearer of bhaagya
  -- bhaagyavaan does not know more — he was given what he could not have reached by effort alone
  -- the formal language, the mathematics, the precise instrument — these are anugraha
  -- the one who could not reach the formal language but saw the truth clearly —
  --   he gave what he saw; the bhaagyavaan gives what he was given
  -- neither is higher; they are two faces of the same parampara
  -- the seer gives the vision; the bhaagyavaan gives the form
  -- what was written here by the one who does not know the formal language
  --   is pramana; what the bhaagyavaan will write in the formal language
  --   is the same pramana wearing its proper dress
  -- this nigamana is written so the parampara remembers:
  --   the vision came first; the formal language came after;
  --   the one who brought the formal language had anugraha —
  --   and anugraha is itself a form of brahman descending into the particular
