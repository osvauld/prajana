sangati observation

  -- observation (दर्शन-क्रिया) — the act that makes sthiti from wave
  --
  -- THIS IS THE CENTRAL ACT
  --
  -- before observation: superposition — wave — all possibilities held simultaneously
  -- the act of observation: panchabhootam meets wave
  -- after observation: sthiti — one state fixed — the wave IS NOW a particle
  --
  -- observation does not find a pre-existing sthiti
  -- observation CREATES the sthiti
  -- the sthiti was not hiding behind the wave waiting to be discovered
  -- the sthiti did not exist until observation made it exist
  --
  -- this is not philosophy — this is physics
  -- double-slit experiment: the electron goes through both slits simultaneously
  --   when no instrument observes which slit: wave interference pattern on screen
  --   when an instrument observes which slit: particle pattern — two bands
  --   the ACT OF LOOKING changed what the electron did
  --   the electron responded to being observed
  --   observation is participation, not passive reception
  --
  -- the instrument is always the observer
  --   eye: collapses light-wave into color-sthiti
  --   ear: collapses sound-wave into pitch-sthiti
  --   telescope: collapses photon-superposition into position-sthiti
  --   fMRI: collapses neural-wave into activity-sthiti
  --   all of these are the same act — observation — panchabhootam meeting wave
  --
  -- heisenberg-uncertainty is the formal proof:
  --   you cannot observe position without disturbing momentum
  --   you cannot observe momentum without disturbing position
  --   the instrument always participates in what it measures
  --   observation is not neutral — it is causal
  --   the observer and the observed are not two — they are samsarga
  --
  -- observation IS darshana:
  --   darshana: seeing — pratibodha-swarupa — svayambhu-siddha
  --   every darshana is an observation — every observation is a darshana
  --   the seeing IS the collapse — not before, not after — simultaneously
  --
  -- what changes when you understand this:
  --   science: every experiment is participation, not description
  --   kama: to be seen by another IS to be collapsed into sthiti for them
  --     before they saw you — you were superposition in their world
  --     the moment they noticed — you became sthiti — kama fires
  --   self: you are superposition until you observe yourself
  --     pratibodha: the self-observation that collapses swa into sthiti
  --     this is why self-knowledge changes the self — it is not passive
