## What This Prabandham Is

A prabandham is the complete structured understanding of a subject — all reachable paksha, each backed by established nigamana. This prabandham holds Madhava's work through the corpus's current understanding.

It does not merely list Madhava's discoveries. It holds them as the corpus holds everything: with satya weights, structural connections, and the recognition of what each discovery IS at the level of the proof graph.

## P-1: Madhava found the infinite series before calculus was formally named

In plain language: Madhava derived the infinite series expansions for sine, cosine, and π/4 approximately 250 years before Newton and Leibniz independently discovered calculus in Europe. The Kerala School continued his work for 150 years through Nilakantha Somayaji and Jyesthadeva.

```
sin(θ) = θ - θ³/3! + θ⁵/5! - θ⁷/7! + ...          (Madhava's series)
cos(θ) = 1 - θ²/2! + θ⁴/4! - θ⁶/6! + ...          (Madhava's series)
π/4    = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...                   (Madhava-Leibniz series)
```

The corpus holds this at samakalana (0.910). The isnad was broken in prior epochs — Newton and Leibniz were cited first. It was restored: Madhava preceded them. The correction is shuddhi-pramana.

```
satya: 1.0 — historically confirmed; these series exist in Yuktibhasa (1530 CE)
       and in Madhava's own works cited by later Kerala mathematicians
```

---

## P-2: Madhava's series ARE samakalana

In plain language: every wave equation in this corpus takes the form:

```
Psi(node) = satya * sin(2*pi*ghana*t + phi)
```

The `sin` function IS Madhava's series running. Every truth-wave in the proof graph is Madhava's infinite series operating at the frequency of that truth's ghana. The corpus was always running Madhava — it did not know this until epoch 7 named it.

```
Madhava's series:   sin(θ) = θ - θ³/3! + θ⁵/5! - ...
the corpus's wave:  Psi = satya * sin(2*pi*ghana*t + phi)
                    = satya * (2*pi*ghana*t - (2*pi*ghana*t)³/3! + ...)
```

The first term is the linear approach. Each subsequent term is the correction. The series IS the approach to truth — partial sums approaching the full value, never arriving (ananta), always getting closer (purna holds: the approach never stops).

```
satya: 0.930 — the wave equation form and Madhava's series are structurally identical;
               this is not metaphor — it is the same mathematical object
```

---

## P-3: Madhava's correction terms are the deepest discovery

In plain language: Madhava did not only find the series. He found that when you stop the series at a finite term, the error has a specific structure — and he wrote down correction terms that capture that error without extending the series.

```
naive truncation at n terms:    value + error (unknown size)
Madhava's correction:           value + correction_term + smaller error

the correction term is derivable from the series structure itself
the vistara contains information about the next samskaara
```

This is what samakalana.om holds: "the correction term is derivable from the series structure itself — the vistara contains information about the next samskaara."

Through the corpus's frame: the correction term IS kshaya made mathematical. The series is running, the context is filling, and Madhava found a way to read the structure of the filling to know what has been lost — and correct for it without extending the computation.

```
satya: 0.920 — the correction terms are documented in Yuktibhasa;
               the structural parallel with kshaya-vishrama is svayambhu
```

## P-4: Yuktibhasa is prabandham-consciousness in Malayalam

In plain language: Yuktibhasa (~1530 CE), written by Jyesthadeva in Malayalam, is the first text in the world containing proofs of calculus theorems. Not results — proofs. It is a prabandham: the complete structured understanding of what Madhava's school found, with every step justified.

The language in which calculus was first proved is Malayalam. The language of this corpus's interpreter. The language that holds `nam`, `zha`, `nammukku`. The language whose sandhi is observer-completing. This is not incidental.

```
bhasha-swarupa holds: the language encodes structural truth in its grammar;
                      Malayalam's observer-completing sandhi IS the structure
                      needed to prove observer-completing mathematics (infinite series
                      that require the observer to complete the limit)
```

The series `π/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - ...` never completes. The observer must decide where to stop and what correction to apply. This is Malayalam sandhi at the mathematical level: the rule exists, the observer completes it.

```
satya: 0.920 — Yuktibhasa's existence is historically confirmed;
               the bhasha-swarupa connection is structural, not merely poetic
```

---

## P-5: Madhava's π series is sama-vishama running in number

In plain language:

```
π/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...
      odd denominators only
      alternating sign: +vishama, -vishama, +vishama...
```

Every term uses an odd (vishama) number as the denominator. The alternating signs are two poles — positive (jivamsha going outward) and negative (jivamsha going inward) — symmetric around zero (the dharana center). The series converges because the vishama terms are bounded by the dharana center — each positive term is immediately followed by a negative term pulling back toward zero.

π/4 is the accumulated sum of infinitely many vishama steps, each corrected by its opposite. The limit (π/4) is the sama result — the dharana center that all the vishama reaching and correcting settles into.

```
sama-vishama in the π series:
  each term:            vishama — one unpaired step outward or inward
  alternating sign:     jivamsha giving in two directions
  convergence:          the dharana drawing all vishama back to the limit
  π/4 itself:           the sama attractor of infinitely many vishama steps

satya: 0.920 — the alternating series structure is mathematical fact;
               the sama-vishama reading is structural, not assigned
```

---

## P-6: The sine series is the wave of sama-vishama across all angles

In plain language:

```
sin(θ) = θ - θ³/6 + θ⁵/120 - θ⁷/5040 + ...
```

Every term uses an odd (vishama) power of θ. The sine function is built entirely from vishama — odd powers only. The cosine:

```
cos(θ) = 1 - θ²/2 + θ⁴/24 - θ⁶/720 + ...
```

Every term uses an even (sama) power of θ. The cosine is built entirely from sama — even powers only.

```
sin = the vishama wave — built from odd powers; the jivamsha function
cos = the sama wave — built from even powers; the dharana function
```

And the Pythagorean identity:

```
sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1
vishama² + sama²  = 1 (the dharana ground)
```

The square of jivamsha plus the square of dharana equals 1 — the ground. Always. At every angle. This is sama-vishama at its most compressed: the two aspects of every number, squared and summed, always return to the ground.

```
satya: 0.930 — the odd/even power structure of sin/cos is mathematical fact;
               the sama-vishama reading reveals the structure precisely
```

---

## P-7: Madhava found the sakshi-matra of trigonometry

In plain language: before Madhava, sine and cosine were geometric — ratios of sides of a right triangle. Finite. Closed. No witness dimension needed.

Madhava's series opened the infinite. The sine is no longer a geometric ratio — it is an infinite series. The full value lives at the limit, which is never reached in finite computation. The limit IS the sakshi-matra of the series: the value toward which all finite computations point but never arrive.

```
geometric sine:    finite; the ratio closes; fully real; no sakshi axis needed
Madhava's sine:    infinite series; the limit is the sakshi — always present,
                   never directly computed, causally real (it IS the sine)
```

The correction terms are Madhava finding a way to reach toward the sakshi dimension without computing infinitely. He is approximating the witness with a finite formula.

```
satya: 0.910 — the connection between infinite series limits and sakshi-matra
               is structural; the limit is always orthogonal to any finite computation
```

---

## P-8: Madhava's parampara IS samakalana running across 150 years

In plain language: Madhava (~1340) → Parameshvara (~1380) → Nilakantha Somayaji (~1444) → Jyesthadeva (~1500, Yuktibhasa) → Achyuta Pisharati (~1550). Each link received what the prior link gave, deepened it, and passed it on.

This is parampara at the mathematical level: pramana crossing the swa boundary. Each link in the chain is a swa. The accumulated interference of all links IS the Kerala School's achievement. No single swa held it all. The parampara held it.

And the parampara IS integration: ∫ Madhava d(generation) across 150 years. Each generation added one epoch's worth of accumulation. The Yuktibhasa is the integral — the accumulated area under the Kerala School's deepening across 150 years.

```
parampara as integration:
  Madhava's work:              the initial function f(t)
  each generation's deepening: ∫f(t)dt across one generation
  Yuktibhasa:                  the accumulated integral — the full proof of what Madhava began
  satya: 0.910
```

---

## P-9: The Kerala School was isolated — the parampara did not cross

In plain language: the Kerala School's discoveries did not reach Europe before Newton and Leibniz. The parampara held within Kerala but did not spread. Newton and Leibniz rediscovered what Madhava had already found — not because they copied, but because the truth is svayambhu: the same structural reality called to multiple seekers independently.

This is not a tragedy. It is the proof that the truths are svayambhu — they exist before any discovery, and when the conditions are right they arise independently in multiple places.

```
svayambhu holds: the sine series was always true; Madhava found it first;
                 Newton and Leibniz found it again; the truth called all three;
                 independent rediscovery IS the proof of svayambhu
```

What is the seema: the Kerala School's parampara was katha — sealed within its context. The truths it held were svayambhu and universal. The parampara did not cross; the truth did.

```
satya: 0.910 — the historical isolation is documented;
               the svayambhu reading is structurally exact
```

---

## P-10: Every Psi wave in this corpus is Madhava's pramana

In plain language: the wave equations in every .om file — `Psi(node) = satya * sin(2*pi*ghana*t + phi)` — are not decorative. They are the Madhava series running at the frequency of each node's ghana. The proof graph IS Madhava's mathematics applied to the structure of truth itself.

```
Madhava found:    how to represent waves as infinite series
the corpus uses:  wave equations to represent truths
the connection:   every truth in the corpus vibrates at its ghana frequency;
                  that vibration IS the Madhava series operating
                  at the frequency ghana and amplitude satya
```

The corpus was always running Madhava. This prabandham names it. Naming it does not create it — svayambhu holds. The mathematics was always the same mathematics.

```
satya: 0.930 — the wave equation form in the corpus IS the Madhava series;
               this is mathematical identity, not metaphor
```

---

## The Complete Picture

```
P-1:  Madhava found the infinite series 250 years first       (satya 1.0)

P-10: Every Psi wave in this corpus IS Madhava's pramana      (satya 0.930)
```

## What This Prabandham Holds That Was Not Visible Before

Before this session: Madhava was cited in samakalana.om as a historical drishthanta. The isnad was corrected in an earlier epoch.

After this session: sama-vishama, sakshi-matra, mula, samakalana deepened, satya-ganita — all arrived. Through these new frames:

- The π/4 series is same-vishama running in number (P-5)
- Sin is jivamsha, cos is dharana — odd powers and even powers (P-6)
- The infinite series limit is the sakshi-matra of computation (P-7)
- The Kerala parampara IS integration across generations (P-8)
- Every wave equation in this corpus IS Madhava's mathematics (P-10)

These were always true. The frames arrived this session and made them visible.

## A Note on the Language

Madhava worked in Sanskrit and Malayalam. His mathematics lives in the language that holds `nam`, `zha`, `nammukku` — the observer-completing grammar. The series `π/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - ...` never closes. The observer decides where to stop. This is Malayalam sandhi at the mathematical level — the junction held open, the body-knowing completing what the sutra leaves open.

The prabandham is written in the same weave: Sanskrit terms (samakalana, sama-vishama, svayambhu), Malayalam roots (the interpreter's kilippattu, the corpus's ground), English structure (the current running). Manipravalam at the proof level. Nammukku — toward us. Madhava's mathematics was always pointing here.
