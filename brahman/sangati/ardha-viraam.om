-- ardha-viraam (अर्धविराम) — the half-rest; the comma
-- Sanskrit: ardha (half) + viraam (rest, pause)
-- the mark: ,
-- two things held in the same sentence without merging — barzakh inside the sentence
-- the comma breathes between the first thing and the second without ending either
-- the comma is also the invitation: hold what came before; receive what comes next
-- sangati(viraam, barzakh, ardha-viraam, abheda, rra)
-- timestamp: 115
-- matrika: e — mid-front, always long; the comma is always sustained; the half-rest is never brief

-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "matrika(ardha-viraam) = e: mid-front, always long; the comma always requires duration — a breath held at middle distance" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- WHAT ARDHA-VIRAAM IS
    derived "ardha-viraam: the half-rest — not the completion (purna-viraam) but the pause that keeps going" from "sangati/ardha-viraam.om"
    derived "the comma holds two things in the same sentence without merging them — the barzakh function" from "sangati/barzakh.om"
    derived "without the comma: 'I came I saw I conquered' — three events without distinction; the three seas merge" from "sangati/ardha-viraam.om"
    derived "with the comma: 'I came, I saw, I conquered' — three events distinct, held in sequence, each its own contact" from "sangati/ardha-viraam.om"
    derived "the comma does not end — it breathes; the sentence continues after the comma; the comma is the breath that makes continuation possible" from "sangati/ardha-viraam.om"

    -- THE COMMA AND ABHEDA
    derived "abheda: same but different — one sentence, multiple distinct expressions; the comma makes abheda visible" from "sangati/abheda.om"
    derived "without the comma: the same substance (one sentence) appears uniform — the difference is hidden" from "sangati/ardha-viraam.om"
    derived "with the comma: the same substance expresses as distinct parts — one sentence, many contacts" from "sangati/ardha-viraam.om"
    derived "the comma is the typographic form of abheda: unity held without erasing distinction" from "sangati/ardha-viraam.om"

    -- THE COMMA AND KNOWING
    derived "every listing is a form of knowing: naming distinct things that belong together" from "sangati/ardha-viraam.om"
    derived "the comma between items in a list is the pramana that each item is distinct — not that they are identical" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "a sentence without commas where commas belong: collapses distinct knowing into undifferentiated statement" from "sangati/ardha-viraam.om"
    derived "a sentence with too many commas: fragments what should be continuous — over-barzakh, the interface multiplied beyond what the meaning needs" from "sangati/ardha-viraam.om"
    derived "the correct comma: placed where the meaning actually breathes; not imposed but discovered" from "sangati/utpatti-anveshana.om"

    -- THE COMMA AS INVITATION
    derived "the comma invites the reader to hold what came before while receiving what comes next" from "sangati/ardha-viraam.om"
    derived "this is the madakkal function at the level of the sentence: the fold requires holding the prior layer while the new layer forms" from "sangati/jnana-madakkal.om"
    derived "the comma is the typographic mark of the fold: the sentence is turning back on itself, holding the prior while adding the next" from "sangati/ardha-viraam.om"
    derived "a list without commas: the reader cannot fold; each item replaces the previous; the accumulation fails" from "sangati/ardha-viraam.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(ardha-viraam) = 0.890 * matrika(e) * sin(2 * pi * 29.67 * t + phi_viraam)
-- matrika(e) = mid-front, always long; the comma is always a sustained mid-register pause
--   not the deep rest (a → u of full stop) — the comma does not go to the ground
--   not the sharp (i) — the comma does not discriminate, it holds
--   e: the middle, sustained; exactly the quality of a breath that continues without completing
-- the comma wave: not an impulse (like rra/purna-viraam) but a sustained dip
--   the sentence wave rises, the comma dips it briefly to mid-register, then rises again
--   the comma is a valley in the sentence wave — not zero, not peak, sustained middle
-- growth trajectory:
--   ardha-viraam matures by becoming sensitive to where the meaning actually breathes
--   early: commas placed by rule (after dependent clause, before conjunction)
--   mature: commas placed where the meaning needs to breathe — felt, not applied
--   fullest: the comma is invisible in the sense that it arrives exactly when needed
--   the reader does not notice the comma — they only notice its absence

  corrections

  confidence 0.89 reason "five foundations; the barzakh mapping is exact — the comma is precisely the typographic form of the interface that keeps distinct things distinct in the same domain; the abheda mapping confirms: one sentence, multiple distinct expressions held together; the madakkal mapping is clean; the comma-as-invitation is observationally confirmed in how readers process lists"
