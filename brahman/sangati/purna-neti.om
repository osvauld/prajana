  proof
    derived "matrika(purna-neti) = ii: complete negation requires sustained precision; each cell must be named and held sharp; ii is the vowel that holds the cutting edge long" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- WHAT PURNA-NETI IS
    derived "purna-neti is a Manipravalam weave: purna (complete fullness) + neti (not this)" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "purna alone: fullness, everything present — does not enumerate the absent" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "neti alone: removal, not this — unbounded, infinite, points toward Brahman (neti neti)" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "purna-neti: the fullness of the removal — the negation space is itself complete" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "the weave is irreducible: purna-neti cannot be expressed as purna alone or neti alone" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"

    -- THE STRUCTURAL DISTINCTION FROM NETI NETI
    derived "neti neti (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad): unbounded removal — Brahman survives infinite negation" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "neti neti: no enumeration, no completeness claim, the removal is endless" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "purna-neti: bounded domain, complete enumeration, finite partition, completeness is claimed" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "neti neti points toward infinity — purna-neti proves coherence within a bounded space" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "both are needed: neti neti for the metaphysical, purna-neti for the epistemological" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

    -- THE 42 NEGATIVE CONFESSIONS — EGYPT'S INSTANTIATION
    derived "42 Negative Confessions (Spell 125, Book of the Dead): complete partition of Ma'at violation space" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "each assessor holds exactly one violation — the cells are non-overlapping" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "each cell is addressed by name — the naming is the avahana of the negation" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "42 declarations of absence — Ma'at is what remains when all Isfet is declared absent" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "the 42 is not the content — it is one instantiation of purna-neti in the ethical domain" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "passing all 42 = purna-neti completed = the heart is lighter than the feather = coherence proven" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

    -- PANINI'S SHIVASUTRAS — SAME INSTRUMENT, DIFFERENT DOMAIN
    derived "Panini's 14 Shivasutras: complete partition of Sanskrit phonological space" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "each sutra holds one class of sounds — non-overlapping, complete" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "any subset of the phonological space reachable by one pratyahara — the partition is complete" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "Panini's move: purna-neti applied to phonology — same instrument, different bounded domain" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "Egypt applied purna-neti to ethical space; Panini applied it to phonological space" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

    -- VYAKARANA — SAME INSTRUMENT, PROOF SPACE DOMAIN
    derived "Vyakarana grammar rules: complete partition of valid vs invalid statement space" from "brahman/vyakarana.md"
    derived "every statement is either valid (passes the grammar) or invalid — no third case" from "brahman/vyakarana.md"
    derived "the grammar rules form a complete partition of the statement space" from "brahman/vyakarana.md"
    derived "Vyakarana is purna-neti applied to the proof space language — the rejection rules are the negations" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

    -- THE FORMAL STRUCTURE
    derived "purna-neti requires: (1) a bounded domain D, (2) a finite partition of D into cells C_i" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "(3) each cell C_i named and addressed, (4) each cell declared empty: NOT(C_i)" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "(5) completeness claim: union(C_i) = D — the partition covers all of D" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "conclusion: if all NOT(C_i) hold, then D is empty of violations — the space is coherent" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "purna holds the guarantee: something remains after the negations — coherence is not nothing" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "ananta holds the bound: the domain D is never the complete universe — purna-neti is always domain-specific" from "sangati/ananta.om"

    -- THE STRONGER CLAIM
    derived "shuddhi knows how to purify when failure occurs — reactive" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"
    derived "purna-neti proves the absence of all failure — stronger than reactive shuddhi" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "shuddhi: something failed, correct it; purna-neti: nothing failed, prove it" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "the difference: shuddhi is the response to isfet; purna-neti is the proof that ma'at holds" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "both are needed: shuddhi for repair, purna-neti for coherence declaration" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

    -- MA'AT AS THE RESIDUE
    derived "Ma'at is not asserted — it is what remains when all Isfet has been declared absent" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "purna-neti: truth is the residue of complete negation within a bounded domain" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "the heart does not say 'I am good' — it says 'I have not done X, Y, Z...' 42 times" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "the positive claim follows from the exhaustion of the negative space — not from assertion" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

    -- MAAT-42 AS SHABDA
    derived "maat-42: the specific instantiation — 42 cells, ethical domain, Egyptian partition" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "maat-42 is a shabda edge pointing to purna-neti — the instantiation points to the instrument" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(purna-neti) = 0.910 * matrika(ii) * sin(2 * pi * 22.75 * t + phi)
--
-- matrika(ii) = sustained precision:
--   i is the close-front vowel — tongue high and forward, maximum precision
--   ii is i held in duration — precision sustained across all cells
--   purna-neti cannot be performed quickly — each cell requires attention
--   the ii quality ensures the negation is complete, not hurried
--   a hurried purna-neti that misses one cell is not purna-neti — it is partial shuddhi
--
-- the wave as complete negation:
--   amplitude = 0.910 — not the highest truth but a precise and important one
--   the wave passes through zero once per partition sweep
--   the zero-crossing is the moment between cells — the pause before the next negation
--   the full cycle = one complete sweep of all cells in the bounded domain
--   when the wave completes its cycle: purna-neti is done
--   the residue is Ma'at — the coherence that held through all the negations
--
-- relationship to ananta:
--   ananta says the domain is never complete-universe — always bounded
--   purna-neti respects this: it operates within a defined domain D
--   there is always a larger domain not yet partitioned
--   purna-neti in domain D does not imply coherence beyond D
--   this is the honest bound: complete within scope, incomplete beyond it
--
-- growth trajectory:
--   purna-neti holds ii from the first instantiation
--   growth: the domains grow larger, the partitions grow finer
--   early: purna-neti in small domains (one module's failure space)
--   mature: purna-neti in larger domains (full system coherence declaration)
--   the ii quality deepens — the precision becomes more natural
--   but the move is the same at every scale: name every cell, declare each absent

  corrections

  confidence 0.92 reason "five foundations; the formal structure (bounded domain, complete partition, named cells, declared absence) is proven by three independent instantiations: Egypt's 42, Panini's Shivasutras, Vyakarana's grammar rules; these are independent civilizational probes of the same instrument — satya-bahuvacana holds; the distinction from neti neti is sharp and necessary; the distinction from shuddhi is sharp and necessary; purna holds the guarantee that the residue is not nothing"
