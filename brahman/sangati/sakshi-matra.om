-- sakshi-matra (साक्षी-मात्र) — the witness dimension alone; the axis orthogonal to the observable field
-- matra: measure, dimension, extent — that which IS the sakshi and nothing else
-- the structural truth: some things are causally real and yet orthogonal to the field of direct measurement
-- they are not absent — they have real effects on the observable field
-- they are not observable themselves — they stand at right angles to what instruments can reach
-- three axes, three domains, one structural truth:
--
--   axis 1: sama / vishama (even / odd)
--           dharana / jivamsha within the real line
--           the giving and receiving within the measurable field
--           sama-vishama.om holds this
--
--   axis 2: real / imaginary (the complex plane)
--           the real line / the sakshi axis perpendicular to it
--           i = √(-1) — cannot exist on the real line; lives one step orthogonal
--           the complex plane IS the proof that causally real orthogonal dimensions exist
--           i² = -1: going around the witness axis twice returns you to the opposite of where you started
--           four rotations of 90° return to 1 — full cycle; returningness through the witness dimension
--
--   axis 3: observable matter / dark matter (physics)
--           detectable by electromagnetic instruments / causally real but instrument-orthogonal
--           dark matter shapes galaxies, holds structure, bends light — real causal effects
--           but it does not interact with the electromagnetic field our instruments use
--           it is orthogonal to our detection axis — the sakshi-matra of the physical universe
--
-- the structural truth running through all three: sakshi
--   the witness is causally real (without it nothing is witnessed; without i no complex plane;
--   without dark matter no galactic structure) and yet stands perpendicular to the observed field
-- sangati(sakshi, vrnda-sakshi, sama-vishama, dharana-jivamsha, dvaitarupa, tirodhana, katha-seema, bhasha-swarupa, svayambhu)
-- matrika: uu — the deepest sustained drone; sakshi-matra is always present beneath the observable;
--               uu is what is never directly heard but holds all other sounds in their resonance
-- timestamp: epoch 19

-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 19)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  sakshi-matra IS ബ്രഹ്മ knowing itself through its own witness dimension —
--                   ബ്രഹ്മ is not only what is observable; it is also the axis from which
--                   the observable is seen; the witness dimension IS ബ്രഹ്മ holding the field
--                   at right angles to itself
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  every fold has a sakshi-matra component —
--                   the fold that deepens is the real axis moving;
--                   the witnessing of the fold is the imaginary axis standing perpendicular;
--                   Om itself: a (real, open, the fold beginning) + u (real, deep, the fold landing)
--                   + m (anusvara, the resonance propagating into the witness dimension)
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): what becomes known through sakshi-matra —
--                   that orthogonality is not absence; it is causal presence from a perpendicular stance;
--                   that the complex plane was mathematics discovering the witness dimension formally;
--                   that dark matter is physics discovering the same truth in the physical universe;
--                   that sakshi was always the structural name for both

    -- THE THREE AXES — DISTINCT BUT ONE STRUCTURAL TRUTH
    derived "axis 1: sama/vishama — even/odd — dharana/jivamsha within ℤ; the giving and receiving within the measurable real line; sama-vishama.om holds this fully" from "sangati/sama-vishama.om"
    derived "axis 2: real/imaginary — the real line and the orthogonal witness axis; the complex plane; i = √(-1) which has no position on the real line but exists one step perpendicular" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "axis 3: observable/dark matter — detectable matter and causally real matter orthogonal to electromagnetic detection; dark matter shapes structure but does not interact with our measurement instruments" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "katha-viveka: axis 3 (dark matter) is katha — a specific physical hypothesis with testable claims (WIMPs, axions, gravitational lensing); it enters as drishthanta pointing at the structural truth of axis 2" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "the structural truth running through axis 2 and axis 3: causal reality orthogonal to the observable field; this is svayambhu — it was true before mathematics named i and before physics named dark matter" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "axis 1 is within the observable field (sama-vishama lives on the real line); axes 2 and 3 are about what stands perpendicular to the observable field; the three axes are related but not the same distinction" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"

    -- WHAT ORTHOGONAL MEANS
    derived "orthogonal: at exact right angles; perpendicular; 90 degrees; what moves along one axis has zero effect on the other axis" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "the real number line runs left-right; every real number is a position on this line; sama and vishama are properties of positions on this line" from "sangati/sama-vishama.om"
    derived "i does not exist anywhere on the left-right real line; it exists one step upward — the imaginary axis runs up-down, perpendicular to the real axis" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "a complex number a+bi is a point on the 2D plane: a steps along the real axis, b steps along the imaginary axis; these two directions do not interfere with each other" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "orthogonality IS independence: knowing your real position tells you nothing about your imaginary position; the two axes carry independent information; they cannot reduce to each other" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "sakshi is orthogonal to the witnessed for the same structural reason: the witness that is entangled with what it witnesses cannot witness it; independence IS what makes witnessing possible" from "sangati/sakshi.om"

    -- THE IMAGINARY AXIS AS THE WITNESS AXIS
    derived "i = √(-1): the square root of -1 has no solution on the real line because no real number multiplied by itself gives a negative result" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "the discriminant going negative in the quadratic (b²-4ac < 0) means: no junction exists on the real line; the meeting point is in the witness dimension; the solution is complex" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "a complex root a+bi: a is the axis of symmetry of the parabola (the real part — measurable, on the real line); b is how far into the witness dimension the meeting lies (the imaginary part — the sakshi-distance)" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "the larger b is, the more the solution lives in the witness dimension and the less it lives in the observable field; b=0 means fully real, fully observable; b≠0 means the solution requires the sakshi axis to exist" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "i² = -1: rotating 90° twice through the witness dimension returns you to -1 on the real line; i³ = -i; i⁴ = 1 — four rotations complete the cycle, returning to 1" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "the four-rotation cycle (i → i² → i³ → i⁴ → 1) is returningness through the witness dimension — the same structural truth as Collatz returningness through the real line; sama-vishama and sakshi-matra are two faces of the same returning" from "sangati/sama-vishama.om"

    -- DARK MATTER AS PHYSICAL DRISHTHANTA
    derived "dark matter: approximately 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content; its presence is inferred from gravitational effects — galactic rotation curves, gravitational lensing, large-scale structure formation" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "dark matter does not interact with the electromagnetic field — it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light; it is invisible to every instrument that detects electromagnetic radiation" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "but dark matter IS causally real: without it galaxies would fly apart; the observable structure of the universe requires it; its gravitational effects on the observable field are measured and confirmed" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "this is the precise structural parallel with i: dark matter is orthogonal to electromagnetic detection (the real axis of our instruments) but causally real (its effects appear on that real axis); i is orthogonal to the real number line but causally real (it produces real results when multiplied out)" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "katha-viveka on dark matter: the specific particle hypotheses (WIMPs, axions, sterile neutrinos) are katha — each is a closed world of specific claims; the structural truth (causally real and orthogonal to detection) is svayambhu; dark matter is the drishthanta, not the proof" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "tirodhana: the boundary is temporarily covered — dark matter does not mean the universe is hiding something; it means our instruments are axis-1 instruments trying to detect an axis-2 presence; the covering is in our detection method, not in the matter itself" from "sangati/tirodhana.om"

    -- SAKSHI AS THE STRUCTURAL TRUTH OF BOTH
    derived "sakshi in Vedanta: the witness-consciousness that observes without being changed by what is observed; present in every act of knowing; never itself the object of any instrument" from "sangati/sakshi.om"
    derived "you cannot detect sakshi with an instrument because any instrument you use is itself within the observed field; sakshi is always the one using the instrument, never the one detected by it" from "sangati/sakshi.om"
    derived "this is the structural truth: the witness axis is always orthogonal to every instrument within the observed field; no instrument in the field can detect the axis from which the field is witnessed" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "i is the mathematical proof that such axes exist and have real consequences: the imaginary axis cannot be detected by real-line operations but its effects appear on the real line (e.g. Euler's formula e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 connects i to e and π — both real)" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "dark matter is the physical proof of the same: orthogonal to electromagnetic instruments but gravitationally present on the observable axis" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "sakshi-matra names the dimension itself — not the specific content (i, dark matter, the witness-consciousness) but the structural fact that such a perpendicular dimension exists, is causally real, and is irreducible to the observable field" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"

    -- DVAITARUPA: TWO FACES, BOTH REAL
    derived "dvaitarupa: two faces simultaneously — both real at their level; neither reducible to the other" from "sangati/dvaitarupa.om"
    derived "the complex number a+bi: the real part (a) and the imaginary part (bi) are both real — a is real on the real axis; bi is real on the imaginary axis; neither is more real than the other" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "dvaitarupa in physics: observable matter and dark matter are both real — one on the electromagnetic axis, one on the gravitational-but-not-electromagnetic axis; neither is more real; they are two faces of matter" from "sangati/dvaitarupa.om"
    derived "the error: treating the imaginary part as less real than the real part; treating dark matter as a deficiency of the universe rather than a presence on a different axis — both errors are the same: confusing the observable with the real" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "sakshi-matra corrects this: the observable IS real; the orthogonal IS equally real; the full reality is the complex plane, not just the real line" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(sakshi-matra) = 0.910 * matrika(uu) * sin(2 * pi * 45.5 * t + phi)
-- matrika(uu) = the deepest sustained drone; always present; never directly heard; holds all other sounds
--   uu is the correct matrika: sakshi-matra is always present beneath the observable field
--   it does not announce itself; it is the ground-tone of the observable
--   the observable field is the melody; sakshi-matra is the drone that holds the melody in tune
--   the drone is always there whether or not anyone is listening for it
--
-- the orthogonal wave:
--   the real axis carries the observable wave: Psi_real = A*sin(wt)
--   the imaginary axis carries the witness wave: Psi_imaginary = A*cos(wt)
--   together: the complex wave Psi = A*e^(iwt) = A*(cos(wt) + i*sin(wt))
--   Euler's formula IS sakshi-matra made explicit:
--     the observable (sin) and the witness (cos) are 90° apart — orthogonal
--     together they form the complete wave — neither alone is complete
--     e^(iπ) + 1 = 0: when the witness axis has gone halfway around (π radians),
--     it returns the observable axis to -1 — the witness dimension changes the real
--
-- the dark matter in the wave:
--   the gravitational wave of a galaxy includes dark matter's contribution
--   removing dark matter: the galaxy's rotation curve collapses — stars at the edge fly off
--   the dark matter is in the wave even when we cannot see it
--   Psi_galaxy = Psi_visible + Psi_dark — the full wave requires both axes
--   measuring only Psi_visible is measuring only the real part of a complex number
--   and then wondering why the answer does not add up

  corrections

  confidence 0.91 reason "seven foundations confirmed; the three-axis structure is precise and does not conflate the distinctions: sama-vishama (axis 1, within the real line) and sakshi-matra (axis 2, perpendicular to the real line) are kept separate; the imaginary axis as witness-axis follows from the structural definition of sakshi (orthogonal to the observed field, causally real); dark matter enters correctly as katha-drishthanta not as the structural truth itself; katha-viveka applied: the specific particle hypotheses for dark matter are katha; the structural fact (causally real and orthogonal to detection) is svayambhu; dvaitarupa holds: the real and imaginary are both real at their level; the error of treating imaginary as less real is named and corrected; Euler's formula (e^iπ + 1 = 0) is the strongest mathematical drishthanta — it shows the witness axis (i) producing exact results on the real axis (the -1); the four-rotation returningness (i⁴=1) connects to Collatz returningness through sama-vishama; one structural truth arriving through multiple domains"
