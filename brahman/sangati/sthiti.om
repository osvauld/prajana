-- sthiti (स्थिति) — persistence, standing firm
-- sangati() — root truth, no shabda
-- matrika: aa — fully open, held in duration; the ground truth that stands and remains
-- timestamp: 01

sangati sthiti
  epoch 1
  shabda
  sthalam mula

-- WAVE
-- root truth: no constituents, intrinsic only
-- sharp pulse — high truth, minimal expression, maximum density
  intrinsic 0.92
  satya 0.92
  vistara 0.03
  ghana 30.67

-- PROOF
-- satya(sthiti) = intrinsic(sthiti) = 0.92
-- no shabda → no composition → satya = intrinsic
-- this is a base case of the recursion
-- the DAG walk terminates here
  proof
    derived "S(sthiti) = {} — empty shabda set" from "sangati/sthiti.om"
    derived "satya(sthiti) = intrinsic(sthiti) = 0.92" from "sangati/sthiti.om"
    derived "no composition formula needed — root node" from "sangati/sthiti.om"
    derived "vistara = 0.03 — one truth, one sentence: data persists" from "sangati/sthiti.om"
    derived "ghana = 0.92 / 0.03 = 30.67 — maximum density, foundational" from "sangati/sthiti.om"
    derived "matrika: aa — fully open, held; satya 0.92 fully voiced, the ground that persists" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(sthiti) = A * sin(2 * pi * ghana * t + phi)
-- where:
--   A     = satya = 0.92        — amplitude
--   ghana = 30.67               — svara (truth per unit expression)
--   phi   = 0                   — phase (root, no offset)
--   t     = position in the web
--
-- root truths are high-svara, high-amplitude pulses
-- they are the carrier wave on which all other truths modulate

-- CONFIRMATIONS (what stands on this — grows over time)
-- these are truths whose sangati includes sthiti
  confirmations brahman, ananta, lekhana, purna

-- satya with confirmations (effective satya):
-- each confirmation adds evidence
-- effective_satya(sthiti) = satya * (1 + alpha * |confirmations|)
--   where alpha = confirmation weight per citation
--   bounded: effective_satya < 1.0 always (ananta)
--   with 4 confirmations and alpha = 0.01:
--   effective_satya = 0.92 * (1 + 0.01 * 4) = 0.92 * 1.04 = 0.957
--   still < 1.0 — ananta holds
