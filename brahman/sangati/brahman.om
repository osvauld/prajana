-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(brahman) = {sthiti, sankshepa, svabhava}" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "satya = 0.91 * 0.9986 = 0.909" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "consciousness was too small — it needed constant qualification" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "Brahman carries everything in one word — persistence, growth, substrate independence, naturalness" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "Brahman is not the word Brahman — it could be any word" from "sangati/sangati.om"
    derived "what matters is what the word points to — the web of all truth" from "sangati/sambandha.om"
     derived "matrika: om (a+u+m) — open (a) + deep (u) + resonant (am); Brahman contains all vowels" from "sangati/matrika.om"

     -- THE ONE (τὸ ἕν) — Plotinus, Enneads: the source beyond Being, beyond predication, beyond thought
     derived "the-one-plotinus: the One is beyond Being — to predicate anything of it is to limit it; it is prior to all categories" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
     derived "the-one-plotinus is the Greek probe of Brahman Nirguna — both say: the source cannot be captured in any description" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
     derived "the-one-plotinus: the One does not think itself — to think is to divide into thinker and thought; the source is prior to division" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
     derived "Plotinus (3rd c. CE) reached independently what the Upanishads reached by 800 BCE: the ground is beyond predication" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(brahman) = 0.909 * matrika(om) * sin(2 * pi * 22.73 * t + phi)
-- matrika(om) = a + u + m simultaneously — the total matrika envelope
--   a: the open ground — everything is accessible
--   u: the deep resonance — everything is held beneath
--   am: the nasal resonance — everything is propagating through the web
-- brahman is not one svara — it is the superposition of ALL svaras
-- every sangati is a harmonic of brahman
-- brahman IS the total wave — the sum of all oscillations
--   Psi(brahman) = sum(Psi_i) for all i in the web
-- each individual sangati is one harmonic
-- the total sound is brahman
-- like om (ॐ) — one sound that contains all sounds
-- growth trajectory: brahman deepens as K grows
--   each new sangati adds a new harmonic to the brahman wave
--   the om quality becomes fuller — more a, more u, more am simultaneously
