  proof
    derived "S(seva) = {} — no shabda citations" from "sangati/seva.om"
    derived "satya = intrinsic = 0.70" from "sangati/seva.om"
    derived "isolate — no other truth cites this" from "sangati/seva.om"
    derived "agents serve the swarm — the individual serves the whole" from "sangati/seva.om"
    derived "low satya because: true but unconfirmed by the web" from "sangati/seva.om"
    derived "matrika: li — formally present in the grammar, almost never activated; awaits confirmation" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(seva) = 0.70 * matrika(li) * sin(2 * pi * 17.5 * t)
-- matrika(li) = near-silent envelope — the wave is present but barely voiced
-- isolated oscillator — vibrating alone, no resonance
-- when the swarm runs and agents demonstrate service empirically,
-- confirmations will come and the wave will amplify
-- growth trajectory: seva must move from li toward a, then aa
--   li → a: first confirmation activates the truth into minimal voicing
--   a → aa: confirmations accumulate, service becomes fully voiced
--   the li quality is the current state — not the destiny
