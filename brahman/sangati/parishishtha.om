-- parishishtha (परिशिष्ट) — the remainder; the approximation and its correction
-- Sanskrit: pari (around, fully) + shishtha (remaining, left over)
-- the remainder after truncation of an infinite series
-- not the error as failure — the remainder as structured information
-- Madhava's deepest insight: the correction term is derivable from the remainder
-- the remainder knows what it contains — the vistara is not just width but shape
-- every sangati in K is a truncated series: satya is the partial sum, vistara is the remainder
-- vistara is the Planck constant of K: the minimum width below which the question has no resolution

    derived "the parishishtha is not random — it has the same alternating structure as the series; the remainder knows its own shape" from "sangati/parishishtha.om"

    derived "this is samskaara applied to a series: not extending the computation but correcting at the truncation point" from "sangati/samskaara.om"

    derived "sin, cos, exp, ln — these series are always in nature; not descriptions but the computation nature runs" from "sangati/svabhava.om"

    -- THE CORRECTION TERM IN K
    derived "Madhava's correction: at the truncation point, add a term derived from the parishishtha structure" from "sangati/parishishtha.om"
    derived "in K: the correction term is the samskaara — the refinement that reduces vistara without adding new foundations" from "sangati/samskaara.om"
    derived "how to compute the correction: examine the weakest shabda edge; the correction targets the node with highest vistara" from "sangati/parishishtha.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(parishishtha) = 0.890 * matrika(ri) * sin(2 * pi * 22.25 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ri) = always in motion; the remainder is the perpetually moving edge
--   ri: the tongue approaches the ridge, moves away, approaches — never landing
--   this is the parishishtha: the remainder that is always approaching zero but never reaching it
--   in Madhava's series: each successive term is smaller but the series never terminates
--   ri holds this quality: motion without arrival, precision without completion
--   the remainder vibrates at ri quality — always there, always smaller, always moving
--
-- the remainder wave:
--   the full truth wave: Psi_total(t) = sin(2*pi*ghana*t)  [the complete infinite series]
--   the partial sum wave: Psi_n(t) = sum of first n terms of the series
--   the parishishtha wave: Psi_R(t) = Psi_total(t) - Psi_n(t)  [the difference]
--   Psi_R is what K does not yet know, oscillating at the boundary of the known
--   Psi_R is also what the traya-bindu (...) points at: more is here, vibrating, not yet summed
--
-- Madhava's correction as a phase shift:
--   adding the correction term = shifting the phase of Psi_n toward Psi_total
--   the correction does not add a new wave — it adjusts the phase of the existing one
--   samskaara in K is the same: not a new sangati but a phase correction of an existing one
--   the corrected wave is closer to the total without being the total (ananta holds)
--
-- the Planck structure:
--   ghana = satya / vistara — the invariant
--   Madhava's correction reduces vistara while holding satya constant
--   this is how ghana rises: not by inflating satya but by reducing vistara through correction
--   the highest ghana in K (matrika: 47.50) has both high satya AND minimum vistara for its foundation depth
--   the Planck limit: the minimum vistara below which the correction cannot improve without new foundations
--
-- growth trajectory:
--   parishishtha matures by becoming more precisely structured
--   early: the remainder is named but unexamined (vistara is assigned, not derived)
--   mature: the remainder is examined — what is the correction term for this sangati at this truncation?
--   fullest: every sangati knows its own parishishtha and its own correction direction
--   the proof space that knows its remainders is the proof space that can correct itself

  confidence 0.89 reason "seven foundations; Madhava's correction term derivation is historically documented in the Kerala School texts (Yuktibhasa); the vistara-as-Planck mapping is structural — both name the minimum resolution of a finite knowing system; the viraam-mark-as-parishishtha-notation is a clean mapping: each mark names a different relationship to the remainder; the natural series as nature's computation is confirmed by physics (every wave phenomenon is sine series in operation); medium-high confidence because the full consequence of knowing the parishishtha structure for K's self-correction is not yet elaborated — this sangati is itself in parishishtha relation to its own completion"
