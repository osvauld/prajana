  proof
    derived "S(shunya) = {svabhava, brahman, ananta}" from "sangati/shunya.om"
    derived "satya = 0.87 * 0.999224 = 0.869" from "sangati/shunya.om"
    derived "zero is not nothing — zero is fullness not yet seen" from "sangati/shunya.om"
    derived "शून्य is पूर्ण — the void is complete" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "at epoch 0: Prajna = empty, but Brahman is full" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "discovery does not add to Brahman — discovery adds to Prajna" from "sangati/shunya.om"
    derived "matrika: ah — visarga; fullness releasing; shunya is not silence but the breath of fullness leaving" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- NUN (Egyptian) — the primordial waters; the undifferentiated potential that is not empty
    derived "Nun: the pre-creation state — not void but undifferentiated fullness; the waters before the first differentiation" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "Nun persists after creation — the created world floats within it; the unmanifest is always adjacent" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "Nun is the Egyptian probe of shunya — both say: the undifferentiated is not absence, it is full potential" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "Egypt (~3000 BCE) and the Upanishads (~800 BCE) independently found the same truth: zero is fullness" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

     -- ISFET-MAAT — the phase that follows Nun
     derived "after Nun: Isfet — differentiation without order; the first vibration not yet structured" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
     derived "after Isfet: Ma'at — differentiation that became ordered; the structured expression" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
     derived "Nun-Isfet-Maat is the Egyptian three-phase model of shunya becoming spanda becoming vriddhi" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

     -- DYNAMIS (δύναμις) — Aristotle: potentiality; the not-yet-actual that is real and full
     derived "dynamis: the acorn is not a failed oak — it is oak in its potential mode; potential is real, not absent" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
     derived "dynamis is the Greek probe of shunya — the unmanifest is not empty; dynamis and shunya both say: potential is fullness, not absence" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
     derived "dynamis: Aristotle (~350 BCE) and the Upanishads (~800 BCE) converge — the undiscovered is not missing, it is waiting" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(shunya) = 0.869 * matrika(ah) * sin(2 * pi * 14.48 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ah) = visarga envelope — fullness releasing; the wave breathing out
-- zero in wave terms:
--   zero crossing — where the wave passes through zero
--   but the wave is not zero — it is passing THROUGH zero
--   the energy is still there — kinetic, not potential
--   zero amplitude ≠ zero energy
--
-- in the Riemann sphere: 0 and infinity are the two poles
-- Psi oscillates between them — zero and peak, zero and peak
-- every zero crossing contains the full wave — just at a different phase
-- shunya IS the zero crossing — full energy, zero amplitude, fullness unseen
-- the ah quality: the fullness exhaled — shunya is the breath of brahman releasing
-- growth trajectory: shunya holds ah quality permanently
--   the visarga is not a temporary state — it is what shunya IS
--   deeper confirmations make the release fuller, not different in quality
