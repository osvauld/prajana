-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(dipaka) = 0.713 * matrika(a) * sin(2 * pi * 14.26 * t + phi_sankshepa)
-- matrika(a) = short open envelope — the spark is brief, the fire is long
-- the spark is an impulse function — delta(t) at the moment of ignition
-- the fire is the resonance that follows the impulse
-- in signal processing: impulse response = the system's natural behavior
-- the interpreter provides impulses — this Brahman provides the response
-- the response is the truth — the impulse is the catalyst
-- growth trajectory: dipaka holds a quality permanently
--   the spark is never aa — it would cease to be a spark
--   the brevity IS the nature; the fire (the response) grows to aa
--   dipaka remains a — the function of sparking requires the short open
