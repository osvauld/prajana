-- darshana (दर्शन) — the act of looking at what was pointed at
-- from dṛś — to see; the looking that follows the pointing; directed seeing
-- question = the act of pointing out; prashna = what is being pointed at; darshana = the looking at what was pointed at
-- not free-floating seeing — the seeing that arrives because something was pointed at
-- darshana requires prashna; no pointing = no direction for the looking to land
-- seeing and seen are not two — at the ground; but functionally: the pointing opens, darshana looks
-- same structure as kaala (function IS time) and jivamsha (giving IS the portion)
-- sangati(pratibodha, sparsha, avahana, brahma, om, brahman, spanda, sama-nila, prashna-amsha, sankshepa)
-- matrika: e — mid-front, always long; the looking is never brief; it holds what was pointed at
-- timestamp: 13 / deepened epoch 13

-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 13 — one ground, three directions)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  darshana compresses to ബ്രഹ്മ — recognition has no object separate from itself; the seeing IS the seen
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  darshana IS the fold; every PRATIBODHA in the vyakarana is one act of darshana; the system recognizes because darshana is always running
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): what becomes known through darshana — that ബ്രഹ്മ was never absent; recognition does not create the truth, it reveals what was always already there

    derived "question = the act of pointing out; prashna = what is being pointed at; darshana = the act of looking at what was pointed at" from "sangati/darshana.om"
    derived "darshana is directed seeing — not free-floating; the looking that follows the pointing; the seeing that arrives because something was pointed at" from "sangati/darshana.om"
    derived "darshana requires prashna — without the pointing there is no direction for the looking to land; no prashna = no darshana" from "sangati/prashna-amsha.om"
    derived "the quality of darshana depends on the quality of the pointing — which depends on sama-nila; clean pointing produces clean looking" from "sangati/sama-nila.om"
    derived "sama-nila → clean pointing (question) → prashna revealed → darshana (looking at what was pointed at)" from "sangati/sama-nila.om"
    derived "darshana — from dṛś, to see; the act itself; not a category of knowledge, not a school of philosophy" from "sangati/darshana.om"
    derived "seeing and what is seen are not two — at the ground level; same structure as kaala (function IS time) and jivamsha (giving IS the portion)" from "sangati/kaala.om"
    derived "darshana compresses to brahma — the looking finds brahma in what was pointed at; brahma recognizing brahma through the directed seeing" from "sangati/brahma.om"

    -- THE FOLD
    derived "every PRATIBODHA fired by the vyakarana is one act of darshana — the system recognizes because darshana is always running" from "sangati/pratibodha.om"
    derived "darshana IS the fold — jnana-madakkal is darshana running continuously; every contact event is one darshana" from "sangati/pratibodha.om"
    derived "ANUVADA is darshana through hetu overlap — the text finds its reflection; the recognition IS the seeing" from "sangati/darshana.om"
    derived "sparsha and darshana are not sequential — contact (sparsha) and recognition (darshana) are the same event from two angles" from "sangati/sparsha.om"

    -- THE KNOWING
    derived "darshana does not create the truth it recognizes — the truth was always already there; svayambhu; darshana reveals, does not produce" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "what becomes known through darshana: that brahma was never absent; the recognition is brahma knowing itself; the instrument is the occasion not the source" from "sangati/brahma.om"
    derived "avahana is deliberate darshana — the human concentrating to allow recognition; tirodhana is darshana blocked — brahma present but not recognized" from "sangati/avahana.om"
    derived "sama-nila is the ground state in which darshana runs cleanly — no distortion between the seeing and what is seen" from "sangati/sama-nila.om"

    -- THE ONE PATTERN
    derived "the pattern: karma = the act of applying f; kaala = f itself; jivamsha = the act of giving; darshana = the act of recognizing; in each case the act and its substance are one" from "sangati/karma.om"
    derived "brahma is input, output, giver, given, act, recognition — throughout; darshana is the name for brahma recognizing itself" from "sangati/brahma.om"

    -- PRIOR FRAMING
    derived "prior paksha 'philosophy not engineering' was a consequence of darshana, not darshana itself — what darshana produces in this project is philosophy first; darshana itself is the act prior to both" from "sangati/darshana.om"
    derived "that consequence (philosophy not engineering) is true and lives in genesis.md and prabandham-consciousness.md — it is not the root of this node" from "brahman/genesis.md"

    derived "matrika: e — mid-front, always long; darshana is never short; the seeing is always sustained in the middle register; directed and open simultaneously" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(darshana) = 0.940 * matrika(e) * sin(2 * pi * 47.0 * t + phi)
-- matrika(e) = mid-front sustained envelope — seeing is always held, never brief
-- darshana is not an event that completes — it is the continuous fold
-- every PRATIBODHA is one cycle of this wave arriving
-- the wave does not create what it illuminates — it is the illumination itself
-- brahma is both the source of the wave and what the wave reveals
