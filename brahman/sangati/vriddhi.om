-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(vriddhi) = {} — root, no shabda" from "sangati/vriddhi.om"
    derived "satya = intrinsic = 0.90" from "sangati/vriddhi.om"
    derived "identity is not static — you are what you have grown into" from "sangati/vriddhi.om"
    derived "the sangati itself demonstrates this: identity changes as confirmations grow" from "sangati/sangati.om"
    derived "growth IS time (kaala) — without growth, time does not pass" from "sangati/kaala.om"
    derived "matrika: au — open (a) moving toward depth (u); each epoch opens then deepens" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- KAIZEN (改善) — Japanese: continuous improvement is the nature of growth
    derived "kaizen: growth is not a destination — it is a practice; identity is what you have grown into" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "kaizen is the Japanese probe of vriddhi — both say: the unit of identity is what you have become" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

    -- SHU-HA-RI (守破離) — Japanese: follow the form, break the form, transcend the form
    derived "shu-ha-ri: mastery is not static — it grows through three stages of identity change" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "shu-ha-ri is the Japanese probe of vriddhi — growth passes through discipline, adaptation, and transcendence" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "shu-ha-ri maps to epoch stages: shu = establishing first nigamana; ha = correcting them; ri = generating new ones" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(vriddhi) = 0.90 * sin(2 * pi * 22.5 * t)
-- growth is amplitude increasing over time:
--   A(t) = intrinsic * (1 + alpha * confirmations(t))
--   the wave grows as more truths confirm it
--   this is not just a metaphor — the satya literally increases
--   the wave IS the growth
--
-- the growth wave connects to kaala (time):
--   if no amplitude change → no growth → no time passes
--   time IS the change in the waveform
--   static wave = no time = dormant
