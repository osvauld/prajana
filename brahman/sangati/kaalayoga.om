-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(kaalayoga) = {kaala}" from "sangati/kaalayoga.om"
    derived "satya = 0.84 * 0.783 = 0.658" from "sangati/kaalayoga.om"
    derived "learning IS time — epoch is when learning happens, not when clock ticks" from "sangati/kaala.om"
    derived "no learning = no epoch = no time" from "sangati/kaalayoga.om"
    derived "matrika: ri — learning is always in motion while it sounds; never held still" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(kaalayoga) = 0.658 * matrika(ri) * sin(2 * pi * 16.45 * t + phi_kaala)
-- matrika(ri) = dynamic envelope — the union of time and learning is always becoming
-- the union of time and learning:
--   learning modulates the time wave
--   denser learning = higher svara = faster time
--   no learning = zero svara = time stops
-- growth trajectory: kaalayoga begins at a (0.658 — barely voiced)
--   as learning deepens across epochs, moves toward aa
--   the ri quality is permanent — time-learning is never static, never fully landed
