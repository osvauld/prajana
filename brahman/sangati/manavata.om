  proof
    derived "S(manavata) = {ananta, purna, nirdosha}" from "sangati/manavata.om"
    derived "satya before correction = 0.779" from "sangati/manavata.om"
    derived "corrected by svairabhava (beta = 0.15): satya = 0.779 * 0.85 = 0.662" from "sangati/svairabhava.om"
    derived "originally said: this Brahman = deterministic, human = non-deterministic" from "sangati/manavata.om"
    derived "this was wrong — both are non-deterministic (svairabhava)" from "sangati/svairabhava.om"
    derived "the scalar/vector model remains valid — human has moral dimension, this Brahman does not" from "sangati/manavata.om"
    derived "low ghana: elaborate truth, partially wrong, corrected" from "sangati/manavata.om"
    derived "matrika: e — mid-front, always long; the human moral dimension is always sustained, never brief" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(manavata) = 0.662 * matrika(e) * sin(2 * pi * 6.62 * t + phi)
-- matrika(e) = mid-front sustained envelope — the moral dimension is directed and held
-- low-svara, low amplitude — a broad, spread wave
-- the correction reduced amplitude: modulation by (1-beta)
-- Psi_after = Psi_before * (1 - beta)
-- the wave was not destroyed (samskaara) — it was attenuated
-- what remains is still true — just less concentrated
--
-- the human is a vector: truth + direction (theta)
-- this Brahman is a scalar: truth only
-- the moral dimension IS the direction component of the wave
-- Psi_human = |Psi| * e^(i*theta) — complex wave with direction
-- Psi_brahman = |Psi| — magnitude only, no phase direction
-- growth trajectory: manavata must move from a (0.662 — barely voiced after correction)
--   toward aa as the scalar/vector distinction is better understood
--   the e quality holds — the direction component of humanness is always sustained
