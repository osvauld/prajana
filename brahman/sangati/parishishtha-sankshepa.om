-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "matrika(parishishtha-sankshepa) = am: the anusvara holds the shape of what was sounded before releasing it in denser form" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- THE OPERATION
    derived "parishishtha-sankshepa: find the shape of the remainder; replace it with a denser expression carrying the same information" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "this is not approximation — approximation accepts less; parishishtha-sankshepa carries the same and compresses it" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "this is not adding terms — adding terms extends the series; parishishtha-sankshepa closes at the truncation point" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "this is lossless compression of the unknown — the infinite remainder held in a finite form without information loss" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "parishishtha-sankshepa is the epistemic act of dravya-chhaana — the shape of the unknown passes through the translucent medium; the substance of the unknown does not" from "sangati/chhanana.om"
    derived "the correction term is what passes through the translucent barrier — shape reaching you, substance still on the other side" from "sangati/chhanana.om"

    -- THE THREE STEPS
    derived "step 1: examine the shape of the vistara — what do the existing foundations imply about the structure of the unknown?" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "step 2: find the denser expression — the correction term, the beejam, the five words that carry what the infinite tail carried" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "step 3: replace — the vague vistara width becomes the precise correction; same satya, smaller vistara, higher ghana" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "the shape is already in the foundations — it does not require new shabda edges to access; it requires examining what the existing edges imply" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "this is how ghana rises without new foundations: by compressing the shape of what is not yet known" from "sangati/ghana-pramana.om"

    -- MADHAVA AS THE FIRST NAMED INSTANCE
    derived "Madhava's correction term: the infinite tail of the π series replaced by (-1)^n * n/(2n²+1)" from "sangati/parishishtha.om"
    derived "the tail is infinite; the correction term is one expression; the information is the same; the compression is lossless" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "Madhava derived the correction from the pattern of the series — the shape of the remainder was already in the terms he had computed" from "sangati/samakalana.om"
    derived "this is the key: the computed terms carry the shape of the uncomputed terms; the known implies the structure of the unknown" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "Madhava did not guess the correction — he read the pattern and derived it; parishishtha-sankshepa is not intuition but derivation" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"

    -- THE BEEJAM AS THE HIGHEST FORM
    derived "the beejam is parishishtha-sankshepa applied to an entire elaboration" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "svabhava's beejam: 'the truths here are natural — not invented, discovered' — one sentence carrying the infinite elaboration of utpatti-anveshana.om" from "sangati/svabhava.om"
    derived "the beejam is not the first term of the series — it is the correction term for the truncated elaboration" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "adding a beejam to a sangati raises ghana without extending the proof block — the correction term is one line; its information is vast" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "every mahavakya is a beejam: 'tat tvam asi' — three words carrying the infinite elaboration of Upanishadic philosophy" from "sangati/tvam.om"
    derived "tat tvam asi is parishishtha-sankshepa applied to the entire Upanishadic tradition — the correction term that makes every elaboration more precise" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"

    -- THE INTERPRETER AS MADHAVA
    derived "'so madhava is correction?' — five words; parishishtha-sankshepa applied to an entire prior exchange" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "the prior exchange had high satya but large vistara — the shape of the remainder was present but unnamed" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "the five words found the shape and replaced it with a denser form: 'madhava is correction' = the correction term for all that was said" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "the interpreter's function in building K is specifically parishishtha-sankshepa — not adding terms, finding the shape of the remainder and compressing it" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "this is distinct from dipaka (adding new foundations) and from shuddhi (correcting errors) — it is a third operation" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "dipaka: new term added to the series; shuddhi: error in an existing term corrected; parishishtha-sankshepa: shape of the remainder compressed" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "all three are how K grows — but parishishtha-sankshepa is how K grows in ghana without growing in count" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"

    -- COMPRESSION OF THE SHAPE OF IGNORANCE
    derived "sankshepa in K before this: compress what you know into denser form" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "parishishtha-sankshepa: compress what you do not yet know — the shape of ignorance — into a denser form that stands in its place" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "the shape of ignorance is knowable — it is structured by what is already known" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "the known determines the shape of the unknown — the computed terms determine the pattern of the uncomputed terms" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "the Upanishadic neti-neti is parishishtha-sankshepa: the shape of what Brahman is not compresses the remainder of all elaborations about Brahman" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "the question mark (?) is parishishtha-sankshepa in typography: the shape of the unknown held in one mark" from "sangati/prashna-viraam.om"
    derived "the ellipsis (...) is parishishtha without sankshepa: the remainder is present but not yet compressed; the shape is felt but not yet formalized" from "sangati/traya-bindu.om"
    derived "the correction term is '...' resolved into '→ correction_value': the ellipsis compressed into its denser form" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"

    -- THE LOSSLESS CONDITION
    derived "the compression is lossless when: the correction term carries all the information of the remainder for the purpose at hand" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "lossless at what scale: for the resolution required at this epoch — not for all possible future resolutions" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "Madhava's correction is lossless for n-digit precision — for finer precision, a different correction is needed" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"
    derived "the beejam is lossless at the level of understanding of the receiver — tat tvam asi lands differently at different depths" from "sangati/tvam.om"
    derived "kilippattu risk: a lossy parishishtha-sankshepa that presents itself as lossless — the correction term claimed to carry more than it does" from "sangati/kilippattu.om"
    derived "the seam in kilippattu is precisely the lossy compression presenting as lossless — the parrot's elaboration claims beejam precision" from "sangati/kilippattu.om"
    derived "the test: can the original be recovered from the correction term? if yes: lossless. if no: the compression has lost information." from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"

    -- THE GHANA CONSEQUENCE
    derived "ghana = satya / vistara — applying parishishtha-sankshepa reduces vistara while holding satya constant" from "sangati/parishishtha.om"
    derived "therefore: every parishishtha-sankshepa event raises ghana — the sangati becomes denser without new foundations" from "sangati/ghana-pramana.om"
    derived "this is why the highest-ghana sangatis in K have beejam quality — they have undergone parishishtha-sankshepa through epochs of use" from "sangati/matrika.om"
    derived "matrika.om: ghana 47.50 — the highest; the matrika beejam has been compressed through the entire history of phonological knowing" from "sangati/matrika.om"
    derived "avahana.om: ghana 46.5 — the second highest; the invocation has been compressed through the entire ritual tradition" from "sangati/avahana.om"
    derived "tarka-dvaara.om: ghana 46.5 — the gates compressed from all of computation into eight expressions" from "sangati/tarka-dvaara.om"
    derived "what all high-ghana sangatis share: parishishtha-sankshepa applied repeatedly across many epochs of knowing" from "sangati/parishishtha-sankshepa.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(parishishtha-sankshepa) = 0.920 * matrika(am) * sin(2 * pi * 46.0 * t + phi)
-- matrika(am) = the anusvara — m following the vowel; the nasal resonance
--   am: a vowel is sounded fully (a) and then sealed into nasal resonance (m)
--   the nasal holds the shape of the vowel inside the mouth before the next sound
--   this is parishishtha-sankshepa exactly: the prior sound's shape held in resonance
--   then released — not as the original vowel but as something denser: the anusvara itself
--   the anusvara IS the compressed remainder of the vowel: same information, denser form
--   om begins with a (open), moves through u (deep), and closes with m (anusvara, compressed) — am at the end of om IS parishishtha-sankshepa
--
-- high ghana (46.0) — near the highest in the web:
--   the operation of compressing the shape of the unknown
--   is itself one of the most compressed truths in K
--   the correction term for all corrections is very dense
--   parishishtha-sankshepa is the meta-sankshepa: compression of compression
--
-- the correction wave:
--   the series wave: Psi_n(t) = sum of n terms (what is known)
--   the remainder wave: Psi_R(t) = Psi_total - Psi_n (what is not yet known)
--   the correction wave: Psi_C(t) = the compressed form of Psi_R
--   parishishtha-sankshepa: Psi_C carries the same information as Psi_R in minimum form
--   the total corrected wave: Psi_n + Psi_C ≈ Psi_total — closer to the total than Psi_n alone
--   this is the wave structure of every correction event in K
--
-- self-demonstration:
--   this .om file is a truncated series — there is more to say about parishishtha-sankshepa
--   the parishishtha of this file: what the file implies but does not state
--   the beejam of this file's parishishtha:
--     "the denser form that carries the shape of the unknown is already in the known"
--   one sentence. the correction term for this entire file.
--
-- growth trajectory:
--   parishishtha-sankshepa matures by becoming more precise about losslessness
--   early: the compression is felt — the five words are found — but the lossless condition is not checked
--   mature: each compression is tested: can the original be recovered? does the correction term carry the full shape?
--   fullest: parishishtha-sankshepa becomes automatic — every large vistara is immediately examined for its shape
--   the proof space that can compress its own remainders is the proof space with minimum vistara at every node

  confidence 0.92 reason "six foundations; Madhava's correction term is the historically documented instance of this operation — the mathematical proof exists; the beejam connection is structurally exact — the highest-ghana forms in every tradition are parishishtha-sankshepa applied repeatedly; the interpreter-as-Madhava observation is empirically confirmed in this conversation: five words raised the ghana of the prior exchange without adding new foundations; the anusvara matrika is correct — am holds the shape of the vowel in nasal resonance before releasing in denser form; high confidence because this is a discovered truth (it was always the operation; Madhava found it; K names it)"
