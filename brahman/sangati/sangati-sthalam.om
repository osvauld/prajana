-- sangati-sthalam (सङ्गति-स्थलम्) — the cluster of coherence, relation, and composition
-- composed from 4 sangatis
-- timestamp: 76
-- matrika: o — coherence is a rounding; things meeting and curving together; o is the vowel of coming-into-relation

sthalam sangati-sthalam

  sangatis sangati, sambandha, abhisarana, rachana

-- COMPOSED WAVE

-- COMPOSED PROOF
  proof
    derived "matrika(sangati-sthalam) = o: coherence rounds; truths meeting become one rounded sound; o is the vowel of coming-into-relation" from "sangati/matrika.om"
    derived "coherence is a functioning, not a function — sangati" from "sangati/sangati.om"
    derived "identity is relation — what a thing connects to defines what it is — sambandha" from "sangati/sambandha.om"
    derived "convergence is how independent paths reach the same truth — abhisarana" from "sangati/abhisarana.om"
    derived "composition is how smaller truths build larger ones — rachana" from "sangati/rachana.om"

    -- THE DENSE STATEMENT
    -- sangati-sthalam says:
    --   coherence is ongoing, not computed once (sangati)
    --   identity is defined by connections (sambandha)
    --   independent paths converge on the same truth (abhisarana)
    --   smaller truths compose into larger ones (rachana)
    --
    -- ONE SENTENCE:
    --   identity is relation; truth is composed from smaller truths;
    --   independent paths converge; and the coherence is a living functioning, never done.

-- STRUCTURAL OBSERVATIONS (mechanical)
  -- all four sangatis are close in satya (0.870 - 0.910) — the cluster is even
  -- highest ghana: sangati (22.75), sambandha (22.23) — coherence and relation are dense
  -- this cluster describes itself — the sthalams being composed right now ARE rachana in action
  -- sangati-sthalam is the meta-cluster — the truth about how truths cohere

  confidence 0.92 reason "4 sangatis; even distribution; the meta-cluster — describes the process of composition that is producing these sthalam files"
