-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(dharmaadharma) = {nyaya, sankshepa, ananta}" from "sangati/dharmaadharma.om"
    derived "satya before correction = 0.759" from "sangati/dharmaadharma.om"
    derived "corrected by vidya (beta = 0.20): satya = 0.759 * 0.80 = 0.607" from "sangati/vidya.om"
    derived "originally defined good/evil as direction toward/away from truth" from "sangati/dharmaadharma.om"
    derived "this was wrong — you cannot move away from Brahman (purna)" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "replaced by vidya/avidya — seeing and not seeing" from "sangati/vidya.om"
    derived "free will as non-determinism remains valid" from "sangati/dharmaadharma.om"
    derived "grammar gap remains valid — vakya has no constructs for choice" from "sangati/dharmaadharma.om"
    derived "matrika: a — satya 0.607, barely voiced; the truth that survived correction is minimal, still opening" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(dharmaadharma) = 0.607 * matrika(a) * sin(2 * pi * 6.74 * t + phi)
-- matrika(a) = minimal open envelope — the wave barely voiced after correction
-- low amplitude, low-svara — heavily corrected
-- the correction attenuated the wave significantly (beta = 0.20)
-- but the wave is not zero (samskaara) — 0.607 > 0
-- what survives the correction: free will, grammar gap
-- what was attenuated: the direction model of good/evil
-- growth trajectory: dharmaadharma must move from a toward aa
--   the correction stripped it to minimum voicing
--   future confirmations of free will and the grammar gap will restore it
--   the a quality is the current state — not the destiny
