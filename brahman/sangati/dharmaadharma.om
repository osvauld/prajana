-- dharmaadharma (धर्माधर्म) — acting from vidya (dharma) vs acting from avidya (adharma) in what was transmitted
-- not good and evil as moral directions — not moving toward or away from brahma (purna holds; you cannot move away)
-- dharma: acting from what is seeing in the kilippattu transmission
-- adharma: acting from what is not-seeing in the same transmission, without knowing it
-- sangati(shuddhi, kilippattu, vidya, tirodhana, karma, darshana, purna)
-- matrika: a — short, open; dharmaadharma is always at the opening — the question of which layer you are acting from is always present
-- timestamp: 30 / rewritten epoch 13

-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 13 — one ground, three directions)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  dharmaadharma compresses to the question — which layer of the kilippattu are you acting from?
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  every act of karma runs through dharmaadharma — the fold always asks: vidya or avidya?
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): what becomes known through dharmaadharma — that adharma is not evil; it is acting from avidya without knowing it; purna holds throughout

    -- THE ROOT
    derived "dharmaadharma — acting from vidya or acting from avidya in what was transmitted" from "sangati/dharmaadharma.om"
    derived "not good and evil as moral categories — not directions toward or away from brahma" from "sangati/dharmaadharma.om"
    derived "purna holds: you cannot move away from brahma; adharma does not take you away from the ground — it is acting from the avidya layer of what was transmitted" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "dharma: the act of karma when shuddhi has done its work — acting from what is seen, from the vidya in the transmission" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"
    derived "adharma: the act of karma from the avidya layer — not malice, not evil; not-seeing acting as if it were seeing" from "sangati/dharmaadharma.om"

    -- THE KILIPPATTU GROUND
    derived "every transmission (kilippattu) contains both vidya and avidya woven together — the actor receives both and must act" from "sangati/kilippattu.om"
    derived "the question dharmaadharma names: which layer of the transmission is this act arising from?" from "sangati/dharmaadharma.om"
    derived "shuddhi is what makes dharma possible — without the separation, the actor cannot know which layer they are acting from" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"
    derived "tirodhana is the condition of adharma — brahma present in the transmission but the avidya layer covering the vidya layer; the actor acts from the cover" from "sangati/tirodhana.om"

    -- THE THREE TOGETHER
    derived "one movement, three names: kilippattu (transmission containing both), shuddhi (the separation), dharmaadharma (the acting from one or the other)" from "sangati/kilippattu.om"
    derived "dharmaadharma is the third term — after receiving (kilippattu) and separating (shuddhi), the act; karma running through the separated or unseparated transmission" from "sangati/karma.om"

    -- WHAT SURVIVES FROM THE PRIOR FRAMING
    derived "free will survives the correction — the question of which layer to act from requires the capacity for choice" from "sangati/dharmaadharma.om"
    derived "the grammar gap survives — vakya has no constructs for the moment of choice; dharmaadharma names what happens at that gap" from "sangati/dharmaadharma.om"
    derived "adharma is not punishment — it is the natural consequence of acting from avidya; the correction (shuddhi) is always available" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"
    derived "ananta holds: dharmaadharma is never fully resolved; each act is a new question of which layer" from "sangati/ananta.om"

    derived "matrika: a — short, open; the question is always at the opening; dharmaadharma is never settled, never closed" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(dharmaadharma) = 0.910 * matrika(a) * sin(2 * pi * 45.5 * t + phi)
-- matrika(a) = short, open — the question is always fresh, never held
-- not a sustained tone (that would be settled) — a repeated opening
-- each act is one pulse of a: which layer am I acting from now?
-- the brevity of a IS the nature — dharmaadharma does not resolve into aa
-- it asks again each time karma moves

    prior_paksha "good and evil defined — direction toward/away from brahma (epoch 3)"
    compression_event "direction model was wrong (purna: cannot move away from brahma); epoch 13 root: acting from vidya vs avidya in the transmission"

  confidence 0.91 reason "grounded in kilippattu and shuddhi which are now clear; the three-term movement (transmission, separation, acting) is self-consistent; free will and grammar gap survive the correction as required; adharma as acting-from-avidya is sharper than adharma as moving-away-from-brahma — the correction is a compression event"
