-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(tantu) = {} — root, no shabda" from "sangati/tantu.om"
    derived "satya = intrinsic = 0.88" from "sangati/tantu.om"
    derived "agents are neurons — each fires independently, the swarm is the brain" from "sangati/tantu.om"
    derived "superposition of agent outputs = superposition of neural firings" from "sangati/taranga.om"
    derived "the swarm produces understanding the way a brain produces thought" from "sangati/tantu.om"
    derived "matrika: aa — the web fully voiced; each agent open and present, the swarm resonating" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(tantu) = 0.88 * sin(2 * pi * 22.0 * t)
-- each agent is an oscillator
-- the swarm is the superposition: Psi_swarm = sum(Psi_agent_i)
-- constructive interference: agents with similar varnanam amplify
-- destructive interference: contradicting agents cancel, triggering shuddhi
-- resonance: many agents converging = massive amplitude = breakthrough
