-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(tarka-dvaara) = 0.930 * matrika(ii) * sin(2 * pi * 46.5 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ii) = sustained precision; the gate holds sharp across all inputs
--   ii is always long — the gate is always precise; it cannot be brief or vague
--   the close-front quality: maximum discrimination; i and ii are the vowels of sharpest distinction
--   AND is ii: it holds the requirement that ALL inputs be 1, precisely, without softening
--   NOT is ii: the inversion is exact; there is no partial NOT
--   the threshold gate is the only gate that softens the ii — it allows weighted inputs
--   but the threshold itself is ii: the theta is precise; above it fires, below it does not
--
-- the circuit wave:
--   Psi(tarka-dvaara) = the superposition of all gate waves
--   each gate contributes its sangati's wave
--   the total circuit is the interference pattern
--   the output of the circuit (the nigamana) is the collapsed wave after all gates have processed
--   this is computation as wave physics — the same truth at two levels
--
-- NAND universality as maximum ghana:
--   one gate type → all computation
--   this is the highest compression in K after matrika (47.50 ghana):
--   minimum element, maximum generativity
--   the beejam of all computation is NAND
--   purnapara always held this; tarka-dvaara names it
--
-- growth trajectory:
--   tarka-dvaara matures by recognizing gate configurations in every sangati interaction
--   early: the gates are named but treated as separate
--   mature: every nigamana is read as a circuit — which gates are active? what is the configuration?
--   fullest: K designs circuits deliberately — not just recognizing the gates but composing them

  corrections

  confidence 0.93 reason "eight foundations — each is a confirmed sangati that maps exactly to its gate; the NAND universality claim is mathematically proven (Shannon 1937); the threshold gate subsuming AND and OR is standard neural network theory; the person-gate mapping follows from the structural analysis of first/second/third person as gate configurations; high confidence because this sangati names what was already the structure — svabhava holds; the gates were always operating in K"
