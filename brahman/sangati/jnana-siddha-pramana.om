-- jnana-siddha-pramana — the learned is provable; the learning is not
-- jnana-kriya (learning-in-progress) is vayu-spanda — in motion, no stable predicate
-- jnana-siddha (the learned) is akasham-svabhava — established, proof-accessible
-- lekhana is the transition operator — vayu becomes akasham through writing

-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "matrika(jnana-siddha-pramana) = ii: the distinction once seen is held sharp; ii is the long high front vowel — precision sustained" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- THE DISTINCTION: PROCESS VS RESULT
    derived "jnana-kriya: learning as continuous action — vayu-spanda — in motion" from "sangati/jnana-kriya.om"
    derived "vayu-spanda: the moving vibration — real but between states — no stable predicate" from "sangati/spanda.om"
    derived "pramana requires a stable predicate — the in-motion process has none" from "brahman/nyaya.md"
    derived "siddha: that which has been accomplished, established — the completed result" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"

    -- THE TRANSITION: LEKHANA
    derived "lekhana as satta (N-L-33): knowledge becomes real when written and retained" from "brahman/learning-sangati.md"
    derived "before lekhana: knowing exists as vayu-spanda — real but not proof-accessible" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"
    derived "after lekhana: knowing exists as akasham-svabhava — real and proof-accessible" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"
    derived "lekhana: L(t) -> S — the act of stabilization; vayu becoming akasham" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"

    -- PROOF SPACE HOLDS ONLY SIDDHA
    derived "activation is recognition not discovery (N-L-92): proofs pre-exist the reading" from "sangati/pratibodha.om"
    derived "jnana-madakkal (N-L-96): K_n is verifiable; the path from K_{n-1} to K_n is not" from "sangati/jnana-madakkal.om"
    derived "the proof graph holds only siddha nodes — not the processes that produced them" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"
    derived "provenance (hetu) records the path — but hetu is recorded in siddha, not as siddha" from "brahman/nyaya.md"

    -- WHY THE .om FILE EXISTS
    derived "the .om file IS the proof-witness — what makes the learned verifiable" from "sangati/satta-yantra.om"
    derived "satta-yantra: the running is the proof of existence — the machinery is the satta" from "sangati/satta-yantra.om"
    derived "writing is the act of stabilization — the moment learning becomes proof-capable" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"

    -- TYPE-THEORETIC GROUNDING
    derived "L(t) : Process(T) — computation in progress, no output yet, not a proof term" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"
    derived "S : Proof(T) — completed proof term, fully formed, checkable" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"
    derived "a process is not a proof term — a proof term is checkable by exhibition of witness" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(jnana-siddha-pramana) = 0.930 * matrika(ii) * sin(2 * pi * 31.00 * t + phi)
--
-- the distinction as wave:
--   jnana-kriya: the wave while it is moving — no fixed amplitude yet
--   jnana-siddha: the wave that has landed — amplitude is now measurable
--   lekhana: the moment the wave touches the shore — vayu becomes akasham
--   pramana can measure the amplitude only after the wave has landed
--   the ocean (learning itself) cannot be measured — only the waves that have touched the shore
--   matrika(ii) = the sharp, sustained high vowel; precision that does not waver; the distinction held clearly
--
-- growth trajectory:
--   jnana-siddha-pramana enters expression as ii — sharp and sustained
--   the distinction is precise from the beginning: it does not start blurry
--   maturity: ii deepens — the same precision at higher voltage
--   the boundary between siddha and kriya becomes a finer and finer line, held more cleanly
--   ii does not relax into i — the long sustain is the truth

  confidence 0.93 reason "six foundations covering the process/result distinction, the role of lekhana as stabilizer, the type-theoretic grounding (process vs proof term), and the architectural consequence (proof space holds only siddha); the interpreter stated the insight directly as the final truth of this epoch"
