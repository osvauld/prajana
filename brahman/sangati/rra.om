  proof
    derived "matrika(rra) = a: the ground vowel; clean contact returns to the ground; 'a' is what you hear at clean arrival" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- WHAT RRA IS
    derived "rra (ற): Tamil alveolar tapped stop — the tongue touches the alveolar ridge once, cleanly, and releases" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "not a trill (multiple contacts) — one clean contact; not a fricative (no friction) — clean release" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "the sound exists at the moment of contact and at the moment of release — not in the sustained gap" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "rra is present in Tamil in high-frequency positions: 'aRu' (six), 'naRu' (fragrant), 'kaRu' (dark)" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "difficult for non-Tamil speakers: Sanskrit has no alveolar tapped stop; Indo-Aryan phonology has no place for this clean contact" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "Tolkappiyam (the Tamil phonological treatise, ~5th c. BCE or earlier) precisely classifies rra — the grammar names the exact contact" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "Tolkappiyam is the second independent axiom-level phonological treatise after Panini's Ashtadhyayi — independent probe of phonological structure" from "sangati/rra.om"

    -- THE COMPLEMENT OF ZHA
    derived "zha: tongue approaches palate, does not touch — the sustained gap IS the sound" from "sangati/zha.om"
    derived "rra: tongue touches alveolar ridge, releases cleanly — the contact IS the sound" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "these are not merely opposites — they are the two poles of the consonant spectrum" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "zha is the approach that is its own destination; rra is the arrival that leaves no residue" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "in K: zha names the approach toward truth; rra names the moment of clean confirmation — the proof touch" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "a confirmation in K is rra: clean contact with a prior truth, then release — the confirming sangati touches and does not cling" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "without rra: K had only the approach (zha) but no phonological name for the clean arrival" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "together: zha + rra = the complete account of motion toward truth and contact with truth" from "sangati/rra.om"

    -- RRA AND SPHOTHA
    derived "sphoTa: meaning bursts forth when accumulated sounds cross the threshold — the arrival of sense" from "sangati/sphoTa.om"
    derived "rra is the phonological form of sphoTa: the clean contact at threshold is precisely rra quality" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "the sphoTa moment: not a sustained approach (zha) but a clean touch (rra) — the consonant reaches the palate, meaning releases" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "rra is the sound of sphoTa itself — the tap that releases the meaning" from "sangati/rra.om"

    -- RRA AND SHUDDHI
    derived "shuddhi: purification — the correction that removes accumulated error; the clean reset" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"
    derived "a shuddhi event is rra in quality: it touches the error precisely and releases — does not dwell, does not accumulate" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "the correction must be clean: too much contact and the correction becomes overcorrection; rra is the ideal correction quality" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "zha and shuddhi: the approach before the correction; rra and shuddhi: the correction event itself" from "sangati/rra.om"

    -- RRA IN THE PROOF SPACE
    derived "every confirmation in K has rra quality — the confirming truth touches and releases" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "the 'confirmations' line in every .om file is a record of rra events — clean contacts that raised satya" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "the confirmation does not merge with the confirmed — rra leaves the confirmed sangati free" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "if the confirmation merged (no rra, only sustained contact): the web would lose its distinction; abheda would become simple identity" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "barzakh at the phonological level: rra is the sound of touch-without-merging; the clean arrival that preserves barzakh" from "sangati/barzakh.om"

    -- THE TAMIL CIVILIZATIONAL PROBE
    derived "Tamil Sangam literature (~300 BCE–300 CE): one of the oldest continuous literary traditions; classifies emotions, landscapes, and states with phonological precision" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "Tolkappiyam classifies Tamil phonology with the same rigor as Panini classifies Sanskrit — two independent axiom-level systems" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "Tamil classified rra as a distinct phoneme when Sanskrit had no category for it — independent phonological discovery" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "the Tamil phonological tradition is the second probe of what the varna layer must contain — after Panini" from "sangati/varna.om"
    derived "satya-bahuvacana: two independent phonological traditions (Panini, Tolkappiyam) reaching for the same truth about consonant structure — satya rises" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "Malayalam also contains rra — Kera-zha-am has zha; Malayalam also has rra; the land carries both sounds" from "sangati/rra.om"
    derived "the land that named itself with zha (approach) also carries rra (arrival) — both are needed to name what the land is" from "sangati/rra.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(rra) = 0.870 * matrika(a) * sin(2 * pi * 21.75 * t + phi)
-- matrika(a) = the ground vowel; short, open, central; the minimal vowel that makes the consonant audible
--   rra + a = the arrival at the ground; the tongue touches the ground and releases back to 'a'
--   the ground vowel is correct for clean arrival: not precision (i), not depth (u), but the ground (a)
--   arriving at truth: 'a' quality — open, minimal, present; the truth is here, not yet held long
--   to hold it long: aa; to hold it precisely: i; but the moment of arrival itself is a
--
-- medium-high ghana — rra compresses well:
--   approach without arrival (zha) + arrival without residue (rra) = complete account of motion
--   two sounds; the whole spectrum of conscious approach and contact
--   but rra is slightly lower ghana than zha because the arrival is simpler than the sustained gap
--   (the gap has more structure than the touch — the gap is sustained; the touch is momentary)
--
-- the tap wave:
--   unlike zha's sustained wave (approximant = continuous airflow through maintained gap)
--   rra's wave is impulsive: a brief high-amplitude contact followed by release
--   like a drumstick on a drum: the contact is the event; the sound propagates from the release
--   Psi(rra) has a different shape from Psi(zha): rra is a series of sharp rises and falls
--   each confirmation in the web is an impulse wave — rra quality
--   the web's overall sound is: sustained (zha) + impulsive (rra) = the full vibration
--
-- growth trajectory:
--   rra matures by becoming more precise in its contact
--   early: rra is a name for arrival; the confirmations are noted
--   mature: the precise quality of each confirmation is heard as rra — this sangati, at this moment, touched this truth
--   fullest: rra is recognized in every correct shuddhi, every valid confirmation, every clean epoch-completion
--   the matrika stays a — the arrival always returns to ground; the ground is where truth is confirmed

  confirmations zha, matrika, sphoTa
  corrections

  confidence 0.87 reason "five foundations; the complement argument is structurally sound — if zha names approach-without-arrival, the spectrum requires arrival-without-residue, and rra names exactly that; Tolkappiyam as independent phonological treatise is historically documented; the confirmation-as-rra mapping is clean: every 'confirmations' line in K is a record of rra events; the land (Malayalam) carries both sounds — empirical confirmation that both are needed; medium-high confidence because rra is not yet as deeply explored as zha in K; the full consequence of having both sounds in the phonological ground remains to be elaborated"
