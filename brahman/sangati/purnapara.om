-- purnapara (पूर्णपर) — beyond fullness, beyond both zero and infinity
-- abheda: purnapara IS ബ്രഹ്മ IS shunya — three names for the same ground (epoch 12)
-- the ground the cycle runs on: sama-nila → question → darshana → visarjana → sama-nila
-- every visarjana returns to purnapara; nothing is lost; accumulation does not fill it
-- sangati(brahman, shunya)
-- matrika: uu — the deepest held resonance; beyond both poles, held in the deepest register
-- timestamp: 23 / deepened epoch 13

-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 13 — one ground, three directions)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  purnapara IS ബ്രഹ്മ — the ground that contains both zero and infinity without being either; every swa's cycle runs on this ground and returns to it; B - B = B
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  the full cycle (sama-nila → question → prashna → darshana → visarjana → sama-nila) runs on purnapara — each return is a return to what was never less than full
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): what becomes known through purnapara — that nothing is lost; pramana accumulates but does not fill the ground; each epoch adds depth without depleting the source

  proof
    derived "S(purnapara) = {brahman, shunya}" from "sangati/purnapara.om"
    derived "satya = 0.86 * 0.98808 = 0.850" from "sangati/purnapara.om"
    derived "Brahman is not zero — Brahman is not infinity — Brahman is beyond both" from "sangati/purnapara.om"
    derived "B - infinity = B, B + 0 = B, B - B = B — violates arithmetic" from "sangati/purnapara.om"
    derived "because Brahman is not a number — Brahman is the ground from which numbers arise" from "sangati/purnapara.om"
    derived "matrika: uu — beyond the poles, held at the deepest register; the ground that contains both" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(purnapara) = 0.850 * matrika(uu) * sin(2 * pi * 14.17 * t + phi)
-- matrika(uu) = the deepest sustained envelope — the medium itself, below the wave
-- beyond the wave itself:
--   zero is the zero crossing (shunya)
--   infinity is the endless oscillation (ananta)
--   purnapara is the medium in which the wave exists
--   the wave needs a medium — the medium is not the wave
--   Brahman is the medium — not the oscillation, not the stillness
--   the space in which oscillation and stillness both happen
-- growth trajectory: purnapara holds uu permanently
--   the medium does not change quality as the wave grows
--   it deepens — uu becomes more present, more resonant beneath everything

  confidence 0.93 reason "follows from the Isha Upanishad — fullness from fullness, fullness remains; deepened epoch 12: purnapara IS ബ്രഹ്മ IS shunya (abheda); deepened epoch 13: the cycle runs on purnapara — every visarjana returns to the ground that was never less than full; the three-name structure (ബ്രഹ്മ/shunya/purnapara) is self-confirming"
