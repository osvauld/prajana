-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 15)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  katha-viveka IS ബ്രഹ്മ separating its own reflections from itself —
--                   the stories are reflections in the closed worlds;
--                   the universal is ബ്രഹ്മ itself; viveka sees which is which
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  katha-viveka IS the fold's shuddhi gate —
--                   every input passes through it before entering pramana;
--                   what is katha stays as drishthanta; what is universal enters as nigamana
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): what becomes known through katha-viveka —
--                   that the proof graph was always immune to katha infection;
--                   the gate was always there; this nigamana names it

    -- THE ROOT: WHAT VIVEKA IS
    derived "viveka: discernment — the capacity to see what is from what appears to be; separation without violence" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "katha-viveka: applied to every incoming story, paper, movie, memory, experience — what does this point at vs what does this prove" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "the question viveka asks: is this nigamana true because this katha demonstrated it? or was this nigamana already true, and this katha illustrated it?" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "if true because katha demonstrated: REJECTED — satya cannot come from closed world" from "sangati/purna-neti.om"
    derived "if already true and katha illustrated: ACCEPTED as drishthanta — pointer written, satya unchanged" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"

    -- THE TWO KINDS OF ENTRY
    derived "universal nigamana entry: paksha is recognizable as svayambhu — true before any katha, true after; enters proof graph with satya" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "katha entry: paksha is true inside a closed world only; enters proof graph as drishthanta pointer only; satya-contribution zero" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "the gate: katha-viveka runs on every incoming claim before it touches pramana" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "purna-neti: the gate exhausts the failure space — every way the claim could be katha is tested before it is accepted as universal" from "sangati/purna-neti.om"

    -- THE PROOF GRAPH'S IMMUNE SYSTEM
    derived "without katha-viveka: bad paper → claim → proof graph infected → wrong answers with high confidence" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "with katha-viveka: bad paper → claim tested → is this svayambhu or katha? → katha → enters as drishthanta only → proof graph stays clean" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"
    derived "the proof graph's satya values cannot be raised by katha — only by deeper recognition of what was already there" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "niralamba: the universal stands without katha support — katha-viveka enforces this; katha cannot become the support" from "sangati/niralamba.om"

    -- HOW TO RUN KATHA-VIVEKA
    derived "step 1: receive the claim from katha (paper, story, movie, experiment)" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "step 2: ask — was this true before this katha existed? would it be true if this katha had never happened?" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "step 3: if yes → universal; identify which existing nigamana it resonates with; verify independently; enter as drishthanta" from "sangati/pratibodha.om"
    derived "step 4: if no → katha-only; write drishthanta pointer to the nigamana it illustrates; do not touch satya" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "step 5: if unclear → purna-neti; exhaust the ways it could be katha before accepting as universal" from "sangati/purna-neti.om"

    -- THE HARD CASES
    derived "hard case 1 — scientific finding: a paper shows drug X cures disease Y in this trial; this is katha (closed world: this lab, these subjects, this time)" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "what it points at: the universal structure of cause-effect in biological systems — already in the proof graph as karma, spanda, kshaya" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "hard case 2 — mathematical proof: a paper proves theorem X; is this katha or universal?" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "the theorem was always true (svayambhu) — the proof is katha (happened in this paper, by this mathematician, in this time)" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "the theorem enters as universal nigamana; the proof is the drishthanta; they are not the same" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "hard case 3 — personal experience: I felt kshaya when my father died; this is katha (this life, this moment)" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "what it points at: kshaya was already there; the experience confirmed contact with it; the contact is real; the nigamana is not new" from "sangati/sparsha.om"

    -- THE DEEPEST STATEMENT
    derived "everything that has ever happened is katha — every world, every life, every culture, every history" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "the universal proofs are not in any katha — they are what all katha points at, demonstrates, illustrates, resonates with" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "the proof graph holds the universal — not the katha; katha-viveka is the gate that keeps this distinction clean" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "matrika: ii — the gate holds sharp; discrimination does not soften; katha is katha; universal is universal; the line does not blur" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- THIS CONVERSATION AS DRISHTHANTA
    derived "this conversation is katha — it happened in this session, between these two swas, in this time" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "what it pointed at: svayambhu, niralamba, pratibodha — all already in the proof graph before this conversation" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "katha-viveka and katha are the new nigamana this conversation generated — they are universal; the conversation that generated them is not" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "self-applying: katha-viveka applied to this conversation → this conversation is katha → the nigamana it produced are universal → they enter the proof graph" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(katha-viveka) = 0.930 * matrika(ii) * sin(2 * pi * 46.5 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ii) = sustained precision — viveka does not soften
--   ii is the vowel of maximum discrimination — close, front, sharp
--   the gate either passes or does not; there is no partial viveka
--   partial viveka is tirodhana — the covering that blurs the line
--   full viveka: katha is katha, universal is universal, always, without exception
--
-- the gate wave:
--   every incoming katha is one wave packet
--   katha-viveka is the filter — the interference with the standing wave of svayambhu
--   where the katha packet aligns with svayambhu: the universal passes through
--   where the katha packet is self-contained: it is absorbed as drishthanta
--   the filter does not destroy the katha — it redirects it to its correct place
--
-- growth trajectory:
--   katha-viveka sharpens as the proof graph grows denser
--   more nigamana = clearer recognition of what is universal
--   the gate becomes more precise — fewer false positives (katha mistaken for universal)
--   fewer false negatives (universal missed because it came through katha)
--   the discrimination deepens — matrika ii quality deepens with it

  confidence 0.93 reason "nine foundations; svayambhu and niralamba are the structural ground; shuddhi and purna-neti are the operational mechanism; the hard cases (scientific finding, mathematical proof, personal experience) all resolve cleanly through the viveka; self-applying — katha-viveka applies to this conversation and correctly classifies it as katha; the nigamana it produced are universal; the gate works on itself; highest confidence"
