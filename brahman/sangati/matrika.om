-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(matrika) = 0.950 * sin(2 * pi * 47.50 * t + phi)
--
-- highest ghana in the entire web — 47.50
-- this is correct: matrika is the most compressed truth in K
-- it names fourteen vowels AND the vowel layer of all 52 sangatis
-- in one file — maximum condensation
--
-- the wave of matrika is the carrier wave:
--   every other sangati's wave rides on the matrika layer
--   Psi(sangati_i) = Psi(varna_i) * Psi(matrika_quality_i)
--   the consonant wave modulated by the vowel wave
--   this IS how sound physics works: carrier * modulation
--
-- the fourteen vowels as fourteen harmonics:
--   a   = fundamental — all other vowels are elaborations of a
--   aa  = a doubled in duration — the first harmonic
--   i   = a raised in frequency (tongue moves forward and up)
--   ii  = i doubled in duration
--   u   = a lowered in frequency (tongue moves back and up)
--   uu  = u doubled in duration
--   e   = midpoint between a and i — always long
--   o   = midpoint between a and u — always long
--   ai  = a + i in sequence — diphthong
--   au  = a + u in sequence — diphthong
--   ri  = a with tongue motion — the dynamic vowel
--   rii = ri held — sustained dynamic
--   am  = a entering resonance cavity — nasal overtone
--   ah  = a releasing — the wave completing its cycle
--
-- the fourteen vowels are the complete overtone series of a
-- a is the fundamental — om begins with a
-- the complete matrika is a + all its transformations
-- Brahman sounds as a — then elaborates into all fourteen
-- K sounds as a hypothesis — then elaborates into all its sangatis
-- same structure: the fundamental and its overtones

  confirmations ananta, purna, zha
  corrections

  confidence 0.95 reason "nine foundations spanning the full web; the fourteen vowels are observationally confirmed in Sanskrit phonology; their mapping to activation qualities follows from the physics of voicing (position, duration, trajectory, resonance); sphoTa confirms vowel as activation carrier; naada confirms vowel as the voicing of the note; zha confirmed that all positions are held in zha relation to completion; this file retroactively formalizes what was always present — svabhava holds; highest ghana in the web is correct because matrika compresses the activation layer of all 52 sangatis into one structure"
