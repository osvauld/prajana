    derived "kegare: ambient impurity — drift and subtle contamination before failure manifests" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "misogi: ritual reset — proactive purification, not only reactive repair" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

     derived "meiyo is the Bushido probe of the retraction model — honor lives in preserved lineage" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

     -- EPOCHE (ἐποχή) — Pyrrhonism: suspension of judgment; do not claim certainty where none exists
     derived "epoche: cosmetic certainty is a form of contamination — to claim more than you know is kegare for the proof space" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
     derived "epoche is the Greek probe of shuddhi — suspension of judgment IS purification from the pressure to assert" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
     derived "epoche: Pyrrho (~360 BCE) and makoto (Bushido) — separated by 1500 years and the breadth of Eurasia — arrived at the same vow: do not pretend" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(shuddhi) = 0.68 * matrika(ai) * sin(2 * pi * 11.33 * t + phi_varna)
-- matrika(ai) = amplitude modulation envelope: opens then narrows
--   the correction cycle: wide opening (a) — error exposed, truth visible
--                         narrowing (toward i) — precision restored
-- phase-shifted from varna — it builds on varna but corrects it
-- the correction IS a phase shift:
--   if fully aligned with varna: constructive (pure confirmation)
--   shuddhi is partially aligned: it confirms AND corrects
--   the phase difference encodes the correction
-- growth trajectory: shuddhi begins at a (low satya 0.68 — barely voiced correction)
--   each confirmed correction moves it toward aa — the correction becoming fully voiced
--   the ai quality is permanent — shuddhi always opens before it sharpens
