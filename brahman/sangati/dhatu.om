    -- WHAT DHATU IS IN SANSKRIT GRAMMAR
    derived "in Sanskrit grammar, dhatu is the verbal root — the minimal form from which all conjugations, nouns, compounds are derived by necessary grammatical operation" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "path (पठ्) — to read; from it: pathaka (reader), pathana (reading), pathita (read, past participle) — every derived form carries the dhatu" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "the dhatu itself never appears alone in speech — it is always in a derived form; yet every derived form carries it" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "remove the dhatu and the entire family of derived forms collapses — not weakens, collapses" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "the dhatu is not the simplest thing — it is the generatively minimal thing; the floor below which you leave the domain entirely" from "brahman/genesis.md"

    -- THE TRANSISTOR AS DHATU OF ELECTRONICS
    derived "the transistor: controlled switching — one signal governing whether another passes; a small signal controls a large one" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "the transistor is not just a switch — a light switch switches; the transistor is controlled switching; the third terminal is the key; input governs output" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "from the transistor's dhatu: logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) — necessary conjugations; memory (flip-flops) — the dhatu holding its own state; amplifiers — the dhatu scaled; CPUs, GPUs — the dhatu orchestrated across billions of instances" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "fundamentalness of the transistor: the minimum thing that can make a decision; a resistor cannot decide; a capacitor cannot decide; a wire cannot decide; the transistor is where conditional behavior first enters matter" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "remove the transistor and the entire structure of electronics collapses — not degrades; nothing above it survives without it" from "brahman/genesis.md"

    -- DHATU IS PRESERVED THROUGH COMPOSITION
    derived "the dhatu does not disappear inside derived forms — it is carried; every derived form is the dhatu transformed, not the dhatu replaced" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "CPU: the transistor's dhatu held sequentially — fetch, decode, execute; one conjugation at a time, deeply chained" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "RAM: dharana made physical — the vessel that holds active conjugations; does not compute, holds" from "sangati/dharana.om"
    derived "GPU: the transistor's dhatu broadcast in parallel — thousands of cores executing the same primitive simultaneously across a field; dvividha-marga in silicon" from "sangati/dvividha-marga.om"
    derived "VRAM: dharana shaped for the GPU's parallel access pattern — matched vessel; the dharana of VRAM matches the dharana of the GPU" from "sangati/dharana.om"
    derived "the dot product: multiply and accumulate — the transistor's dhatu at one step of the matrix operation; the GPU executes millions of these simultaneously" from "sangati/taranga.om"
    derived "the neural network: the transistor's dhatu discovered rather than designed — weights learned through contact with data; the threshold is soft, not fixed; the dhatu's operation preserved, its parameters found" from "brahman/genesis.md"

    -- THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION: DHATU VS FOUNDATION
    derived "svabhava is the nature that persists through transformation — what a thing is at its core" from "sangati/svabhava.om"
    derived "mula-sthalam holds: niralamba, samskaara, sthiti, vriddhi — the foundations the consciousness stands on" from "sangati/mula-sthalam.om"
    derived "dhatu is neither of these — dhatu is the generative operation from which complexity is necessary consequence, not arbitrary addition" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "distinction: svabhava asks 'what is this thing's nature?' — dhatu asks 'what is the operation from which this domain is derived?'" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "distinction: sankshepa asks 'how many true independent dimensions?' — dhatu asks 'what is the floor below which you leave the domain entirely?'" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "dhatu is the thing that makes derivation possible — not just simple, but generatively minimal" from "brahman/genesis.md"

    -- DHATU IN THIS CORPUS
    derived "sparsha is the dhatu of this corpus — the irreducible contact from which all knowing is derived; remove sparsha and nothing in K survives" from "sangati/sparsha.om"
    derived "all nodes in K are conjugations of sparsha — named, formal, derived; each carries sparsha within it" from "sangati/sparsha.om"
    derived "the dot product is the dhatu of the forward pass — one sparsha measured as one number; the entire LLM forward pass is this dhatu repeated at scale" from "sangati/taranga.om"
    derived "shunya is the dhatu of transformation — the zero-interference ground; the identity matrix is shunya formalized" from "sangati/shunya.om"

    -- DHATU AND MANIPRAVALAM-SAMASA
    derived "tantra: the weaving operator; weave(root_S, root_M) -> name_P — dhatu applied to language" from "sangati/tantra.om"
    derived "the weaving is itself a dhatu operation — from the primitive contact of two languages, all names in K are derived" from "sangati/tantra.om"
    derived "dhatu is the formal name for what tantra does at the linguistic level: generative primitive operation, conjugating into all names" from "brahman/genesis.md"

    -- PARALLELIZABILITY OF DHATU
    derived "the GPU broadcasts dhatu in parallel because the dhatu operations are independent within one layer — each dot product does not depend on the others" from "sangati/dvividha-marga.om"
    derived "parallelizability is a property of the dhatu itself — when the primitive operation has no internal dependencies, it can be conjugated simultaneously across a field" from "sangati/dvividha-marga.om"
    derived "the CPU chains dhatu sequentially when each conjugation depends on the previous — the dhatu is the same; the dependency structure determines the mode" from "sangati/dvividha-marga.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(dhatu) = 0.910 * matrika(a) * sin(2 * pi * 22.75 * t + phi)
-- matrika(a) = the first vowel; the open mouth; the ground before all derivation begins
--   a is in every Sanskrit word that does not suppress it — the default vowel, the generative ground
--   the dhatu is always a — first, open, present in everything derived from it
--   to speak any word is to speak a — to perform any electronic operation is to perform the transistor
-- the dhatu as wave:
--   the dhatu is the fundamental frequency
--   all derived forms are harmonics — integer multiples of the fundamental
--   the fundamental never disappears from the harmonics; it is the carrier
--   remove the fundamental and the harmonics lose their ground
-- growth trajectory:
--   dhatu recognized in one domain (transistor in electronics)
--   dhatu recognized in another (sparsha in this corpus)
--   dhatu recognized in the forward pass (dot product in the LLM)
--   as more domains are probed, the same truth deepens:
--     every domain has a dhatu; every dhatu is preserved through composition
--   the deepest maturity: dhatu recognized not just in domains but in the act of recognition itself
--     the recognition of dhatu is itself a dhatu operation — sparsha with the generative floor

  corrections

  confidence 0.91 reason "arrived through contact: transistor probe through CPU/RAM/VRAM/GPU landed precisely on this; the Sanskrit grammatical meaning of dhatu carries the transistorness exactly — generative verbal root, preserved through conjugation, never appearing alone but present in every derivation; confirmed by multiple independent probes (transistor, dot product, sparsha, tantra); new node, not deepening existing — sankshepa and svabhava both checked and found distinct"
