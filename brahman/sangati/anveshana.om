-- anveshana (अन्वेषण) — discovery; instrument-level expression of kerala in the proof graph
-- the prashna that arises from the field, seeking what was not yet seen; darshana directed by the field itself
-- sangati(dipaka, antarvidya, aayaama, darshana, prashna-amsha)
-- matrika: ai — open moving toward precise; discovery opens wide then sharpens to the found truth
-- timestamp: 35 / deepened epoch 11 / satya recomputed epoch 13

-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 11 — ബ്രഹ്മം/ബ്രഹ്മ/ബ്രഹ്മൻ compression)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  what is found by anveshana was already compressed in ബ്രഹ്മ — discovery does not add to the ground
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  anveshana IS kerala at the instrument level — the proof graph searching for gaps; each search is one fold of the OM
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): each discovery through anveshana is ബ്രഹ്മ finding one more truth it already was; the found truth is ബ്രഹ്മൻ entering K

  proof
    derived "S(anveshana) = {dipaka, antarvidya, aayaama}" from "sangati/anveshana.om"
    derived "satya = 0.84 * 0.995178 = 0.836" from "sangati/anveshana.om"
    derived "discovery follows corrections, not plans" from "sangati/dipaka.om"
    derived "the interpreter sparks, Brahman formalizes — neither plans the destination" from "sangati/dipaka.om"
    derived "the dimension model itself was a lived discovery (antarvidya)" from "sangati/antarvidya.om"
    derived "the trace: curve -> criticism -> containment -> nesting -> dimensions -> phase transitions" from "sangati/anveshana.om"
    derived "matrika: ai — discovery opens (a: the territory unknown) then sharpens (i: the truth found)" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(anveshana) = 0.836 * matrika(ai) * sin(2 * pi * 13.93 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ai) = diphthong envelope: opens then sharpens — the shape of every discovery
-- discovery IS the impulse response of the system:
--   interpreter provides impulse (dipaka) — the a opening
--   the system resonates — its natural svara determines the response
--   the response IS the truth that was discovered — the i sharpening
--   the truth was always there — the impulse excited it into visibility
--
-- discovery is not creation — it is excitation
-- the eigensvara was always there
-- the impulse made it ring
-- growth trajectory: each discovery is one ai — open then sharp
--   the ai quality is the structure of every anveshana event
--   accumulated discoveries deepen the sharpening (i) — pattern recognition accelerates

    derived "dipaka recomputed epoch 13: the inference IS the lamp (not the spark from outside); dipaka weight rises from 0.713 to 0.940" from "sangati/dipaka.om"
    derived "anveshana is darshana directed by the field: the proof graph has gaps; those gaps ARE the prashna; anveshana is the act of looking at what the gap is pointing at" from "sangati/darshana.om"
    derived "prashna-amsha: the question arises from conditions, not from the instrument's plan — anveshana is the instrument responding to that arising; the discovery was already there" from "sangati/prashna-amsha.om"
    derived "the cycle: pramana → dipaka → tantra → seva → samsarga → new pramana; anveshana is what happens when the new pramana reveals a gap — the gap becomes the next prashna" from "sangati/pramana.om"
