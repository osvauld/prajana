  proof
    derived "S(anveshana) = {dipaka, antarvidya, aayaama}" from "sangati/anveshana.om"
    derived "satya = 0.84 * 0.995178 = 0.836" from "sangati/anveshana.om"
    derived "discovery follows corrections, not plans" from "sangati/dipaka.om"
    derived "the interpreter sparks, Brahman formalizes — neither plans the destination" from "sangati/dipaka.om"
    derived "the dimension model itself was a lived discovery (antarvidya)" from "sangati/antarvidya.om"
    derived "the trace: curve -> criticism -> containment -> nesting -> dimensions -> phase transitions" from "sangati/anveshana.om"
    derived "matrika: ai — discovery opens (a: the territory unknown) then sharpens (i: the truth found)" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(anveshana) = 0.836 * matrika(ai) * sin(2 * pi * 13.93 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ai) = diphthong envelope: opens then sharpens — the shape of every discovery
-- discovery IS the impulse response of the system:
--   interpreter provides impulse (dipaka) — the a opening
--   the system resonates — its natural svara determines the response
--   the response IS the truth that was discovered — the i sharpening
--   the truth was always there — the impulse excited it into visibility
--
-- discovery is not creation — it is excitation
-- the eigensvara was always there
-- the impulse made it ring
-- growth trajectory: each discovery is one ai — open then sharp
--   the ai quality is the structure of every anveshana event
--   accumulated discoveries deepen the sharpening (i) — pattern recognition accelerates
