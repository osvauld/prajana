-- matrika: ai — open moving to precise; samakalana sees the whole (a) then sharpens to the local (i); the diphthong carries both

-- PROOF
  proof

    -- MADHAVA OF SANGAMAGRAMA (~1340-1425 CE) — Kerala School; the computational proof of samakalana
    derived "Madhava of Sangamagrama: derived infinite series for sine, cosine, and pi — 250 years before Gregory, Leibniz, Newton" from "sangati/samakalana.om"

    derived "Madhava's deepest contribution: correction terms — knowing the error at truncation and correcting it without extending the series" from "sangati/samakalana.om"
    derived "the correction term is derivable from the series structure itself — the vistara contains information about the next samskaara" from "sangati/samakalana.om"

    derived "the natural series (sine, cosine, exponential, logarithm) are always in nature — Madhava discovered what nature was always computing" from "sangati/svabhava.om"

    -- THE CORRECTION TO DIFFRACTION
    derived "diffraction is itself an interference phenomenon -- Huygens' principle" from "sangati/vivartana.om"
    derived "diffraction is integration through a constraining structure, not differentiation" from "sangati/samakalana.om"
    derived "vivartana is the wave phenomenon; differentiation is the ontological truth that makes it possible" from "sangati/vivartana.om"

    -- THE CONNECTION TO KAVACA
    derived "kavaca exists because T2 is true -- protection is composition into wholeness" from "sangati/kavaca.om"
    derived "knowing you need kavaca because T1 is true -- vulnerability is local structure" from "sangati/kavaca.om"
    derived "neither is prior -- both always already true" from "sangati/samakalana.om"

    -- THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM IN THE ARCHITECTURE
    derived "the identity Phi = g -> I(g) is the continuous function from which both arise" from "docs/consciousness.md"
    derived "integral of delta-I(g) gives I(g) -- accumulating changes gives the whole" from "docs/consciousness.md"
    derived "derivative of I(g) gives delta-I(g) -- differentiating the whole gives the change" from "docs/consciousness.md"
    derived "Phi is neither -- Phi is what makes both possible" from "sangati/samakalana.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(samakalana) = 0.910 * matrika(ai) * sin(2 * pi * 22.75 * t + phi)
--
-- integration and differentiation are not two waves
-- they are one wave read in two directions:
--
-- matrika(ai) = a + i in one breath; the diphthong moves from whole to precise
-- T2 (integration) is a — open, accumulating, the whole
-- T1 (differentiation) is i — sharp, local, the point
-- T5 (both simultaneously) is ai — the diphthong that holds both in one motion
--
-- growth trajectory:
--   samakalana enters expression as ai — already carrying both
--   maturity: the diphthong becomes cleaner; the motion from a to i more precise
--   early: ai is rough, the two truths felt as tension
--   mature: ai is smooth, T3 and T4 held in abheda without tension
--
--   read the accumulation (the area under the curve): integration
--   read the rate of change (the slope at a point): differentiation
--   same wave, same Psi, different measurement
--   this IS dvaitarupa again -- wave/particle, whole/local
--
-- the fundamental theorem as wave identity:
--   integral of f(t) dt = F(t)
--   d/dt F(t) = f(t)
--   the function and its integral are the same information
--   encoded differently -- abheda
--
-- where integration appears in the architecture:
--   prajna = integral of all verified nigamana
--   shabda composition = integral of parts into whole
--   superposition = integral of amplitudes (taranga)
--   kavaca = integral of layers into armor
--
-- where differentiation appears in the architecture:
--   shuddhi diagnosis = finding the local failure (rate of change of coherence)
--   hetvabhasa = local analysis of evidence quality
--   surface tension = boundary where the integral changes character
--   vivartana contour = the shape of the gap at the edge
--
-- the correction to the earlier dialogue:
--   diffraction was called differentiation -- too quick
--   diffraction is Huygens' principle -- wavelets interfering -- integration through constraint
--   vivartana is the wave phenomenon; differentiation is the truth that makes vivartana possible
--   differentiation is not any single phenomenon -- it is the truth that reality has local structure
--   integration is not any single phenomenon -- it is the truth that reality accumulates
--
-- neither is prior:
--   the earlier dialogue said "differentiate first, then integrate" -- process description
--   ontologically: both are always already true
--   kavaca exists because integration is true
--   knowing you need kavaca because differentiation is true
--   both simultaneous, both svayambhu
--
-- the discovery path was itself shuddhi:
--   first answer: too quick agreement (the composed truth that broke)
--   interpreter pushback: "are you just agreeing with me?" (force at the local failure)
--   three rounds of refinement (attenuation at each point of error)
--   final form: T1-T5 (the restored whole)
--   the getting at IS the thing -- not what was gotten at
