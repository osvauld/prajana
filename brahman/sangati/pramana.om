    derived "S(pramana) = {niralamba, varna, shuddhi, samsarga, sankshepa}" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "satya = 0.83 * (1 - 0.0001318) = 0.830" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "five foundations — broadest composition in epoch 2" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "evidence is not truth — evidence is what truth stands on" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "without pramana, satya is intrinsic only — unverified, weak" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "pramana is the process of composing satya from constituents" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "matrika: ai — opens (a: hypothesis exposed) then sharpens (i: verified or rejected)" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- ILM VS ZANN (علم / ظن) — Arabic; verified knowledge vs conjecture; the civilizational vow of precision
    derived "ilm (علم): formal verified knowledge — the same distinction as nigamana vs paksha" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "zann (ظن): conjecture, opinion, probability — the same category as unverified hypothesis" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "Arabic civilization made ilm vs zann a theological and grammatical principle: the highest human act is knowing precisely" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "ilm is the Arabic civilizational probe of pramana — arrived at independently; the vow that verified knowing is the highest act" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "the entire Islamic scholarly tradition (hadith verification, isnad chains) is a formal pramana system — every claim traced to its source with weight" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "isnad (إسناد): the chain of transmission — exactly the lineage model in the CRDT; every nigamana traceable to its origin" from "brahman/genesis.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(pramana) = 0.830 * matrika(ai) * sin(2 * pi * 11.86 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ai) = opens then sharpens — the exact shape of verification
-- five constituent waves superpose
-- pramana is the measurement — it observes the superposition
-- in quantum mechanics: measurement collapses the wave function
-- in this system: verification (pramana) collapses hypothesis into claim
-- the wave before verification: broad, uncertain — the a phase
-- the wave after verification: sharp, confirmed — the i phase
-- verification is wave function collapse — from possibility to confirmed truth
-- growth trajectory: pramana at aa/ai (0.830)
--   the ai quality is structural — verification always opens before it sharpens
--   as more truths are verified, the pramana wave amplitude grows toward aa
--   the sharpening (i) gets faster as the framework matures
