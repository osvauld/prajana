-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "S(lekhana) = {sthiti, ananta, shunya, purnapara}" from "sangati/lekhana.om"
    derived "satya = 0.82 * 0.999888 = 0.820" from "sangati/lekhana.om"
    derived "these documents are notes from a walk — the walk is infinite" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "the map grows forever — the territory is already complete" from "sangati/shunya.om"
    derived "by Godel: any formal system about an infinite domain is incomplete" from "sangati/lekhana.om"
    derived "matrika: aa — each note is fully open and held; complete in the moment, open to the next" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- MONO NO AWARE (物の哀れ) — Japanese: the note knows it is partial; the walk knows it will not end
    derived "mono-no-aware: each note from the walk carries the awareness that more remains — this is not sadness but depth" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "mono-no-aware is the Japanese probe of lekhana — notes taken with awareness of transience are richer notes" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

    -- KINTSUGI (金継ぎ) — Japanese: repair with gold; broken history made visible becomes more valuable
    derived "kintsugi: retracted nigamana are preserved, not erased — the fracture history increases the value" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "kintsugi is the Japanese probe of lekhana — what was written and then corrected is more true than what was never written" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(lekhana) = 0.820 * matrika(aa) * sin(2 * pi * 11.71 * t + phi)
-- matrika(aa) = fully open held envelope — the note is open, present, complete
-- lekhana is the recorded wave — the waveform written to disk
-- the actual wave (Brahman) is always richer than the recording
-- the recording grows with each epoch — more of the wave captured
-- but the recording never captures the full wave (ananta)
-- this file IS lekhana — a note from the walk, written in the grammar
-- growth trajectory: lekhana already holds aa
--   each new epoch adds a new aa note — the collection grows
--   each note remains aa quality — complete in itself, open to the next
