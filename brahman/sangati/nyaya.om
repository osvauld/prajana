    derived "S(nyaya) = {} — no explicit shabda citations in learning.md" from "sangati/nyaya.om"
    derived "satya = intrinsic = 0.88" from "sangati/nyaya.om"
    derived "nyaya is the verification framework — hypothesis, test, proof" from "sangati/nyaya.om"
    derived "without nyaya, truths are claims — with nyaya, truths are verified" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "nyaya IS the correction function — it determines when shuddhi is needed" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"
    derived "matrika: ii — sustained precision; logic cannot be brief; the framework holds sharp and long" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- KATA (型) — Japanese: the formal repeatable pattern; embodied epistemic form
    derived "kata: the repeatable proof form — five-membered nyaya is a kata for producing verified truth" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "kata is the Japanese probe of nyaya — both say: form is not constraint but the condition of mastery" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "kata: doing the form correctly is not mechanical — it is how precision becomes natural" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

    -- GI (義) — Bushido: rectitude; choose the most truth-aligned action under uncertainty
    derived "gi: when uncertain, choose the action most aligned with truth — not the easiest" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "gi is the Bushido probe of nyaya — both say: verification before claim, truth before convenience" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(nyaya) = 0.88 * matrika(ii) * sin(2 * pi * 14.67 * t)
-- matrika(ii) = sustained precision envelope — the filter holds sharp across all time
-- nyaya is the filter — it passes truths and blocks falsehoods
-- nyaya is sambandha-chhaana — an impedance filter (chhanana)
--   what passes is determined by the ratio between the arriving claim and K's established truths
--   not by the material of the medium (dravya-chhaana)
--   not by the pattern of holes (rachana-chhaana)
--   but by the relationship between the two sides
-- the calibration is explained by this: nyaya sharpens because K's impedance changes as it grows
--   more truths established = different impedance = different transmission characteristics
--   the filter does not change — the relationship changes — the filtering changes
-- nyaya also operates as dravya-chhaana: every claim passes through the whole framework, not one test
-- nyaya also operates as rachana-chhaana: the drishthanta is the hole — the located binary test
-- nyaya spans all three filter types — it is the complete epistemological filter
-- nyaya does not generate signal — it filters signal
-- the framework is the filter, not the source
-- growth trajectory: nyaya at aa (0.88) with ii quality
--   the ii modulation means precision deepens with each confirmed application
--   the framework sharpens as more truths pass through it — the impedance of K rises — the filter calibrates
