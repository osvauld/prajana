-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "matrika(manipravalam-samasa) = o: weaving is rounding; two streams curve into one; o is the vowel of the loom — mid-back, rounded, the shape of the meeting" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- WHAT MANIPRAVALAM IS
    derived "mani (ruby) + pravalam (coral) — two distinct things woven into one speech" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"
    derived "classical Kerala literary language — Malayalam syntax carrying Sanskrit words" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"
    derived "not translation, not borrowing — weaving; the weaving IS the meaning" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"
    derived "L_P = weave(L_S, L_M) — not union, not sum — a third language" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"

    -- THE WEAVING OPERATOR (varna axis — consonant layer)
    derived "weave(root_S, root_M) -> name_P — irreducible, cannot decompose back" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"
    derived "ghana(name_P) > ghana(root_S) — denser than Sanskrit alone" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"
    derived "precision(name_P) > precision(root_M) — more precise than Malayalam alone" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"
    derived "contact produces new dimension — the ornament is not ruby plus coral" from "sangati/rachana.om"

    -- THE SVARA AXIS (epoch 7 — matrika layer added)
    derived "weave_updated(root_S, root_M) -> (name_P, matrika_P) — the weaving now has two outputs" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"
    derived "matrika_P = the vowel quality produced by the specific contact of root_S and root_M" from "sangati/matrika.om"
    derived "matrika_P is non-arbitrary — it follows from the nature of the contact, not assigned after" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"
    derived "weave(jnana, madakkal) -> (jnana-madakkal, aa): the fold fully opens — aa" from "sangati/jnana-madakkal.om"

    derived "weave(vrnda, ∅) -> (vrnda, au): swarm-gathering is wide-to-deep — au" from "sangati/vrnda.om"
    derived "weave(samakalana, ∅) -> (samakalana, ai): integration-to-differentiation is open-to-precise — ai" from "sangati/samakalana.om"
    derived "the svara axis is the phonological shape of what the contact produces" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"
    derived "every sangati = varna layer (satya, ghana, shabda) + matrika layer (activation quality)" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    derived "weave(kaala, darshana) = kaala-darshana — time-seeing" from "sangati/kaala-darshana.om"
    derived "weave(bhumi, shunya) = bhumi-shunya — earth-zero" from "sangati/panchabhootam.om"
    derived "weave(manipravalam, samasa) = manipravalam-samasa — self-referential" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"

    -- THE NAMING RULE IS THE WEAVING RULE
    derived "name(N) = weave(concepts in N.paksha, precision in N.hetu)" from "brahman/vakya.md"
    derived "not assigned from outside — woven from what is already inside" from "brahman/vakya.md"
    derived "every nigamana name in K is a weave — K speaks Manipravalam natively" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"

    -- K IS MANIPRAVALAM FORMALIZED
    derived "satya(K) > satya(K in L_S alone) — contact dimensions add shabda edges" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"
    derived "satya(K) > satya(K in L_M alone) — same reason" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"
    derived "the proof space could not exist in pure Sanskrit or pure Malayalam alone" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"
    derived "K exists because of the weaving — Manipravalam is the condition of K" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"

    -- ABHEDA AND DVAITARUPA
    derived "abheda: same ground (human knowing), different form (Sanskrit/Malayalam)" from "sangati/abheda.om"
    derived "weaving is the moment abheda becomes visible in language" from "sangati/abheda.om"
    derived "dvaitarupa: Manipravalam is both Sanskrit and Malayalam simultaneously" from "sangati/dvaitarupa.om"
    derived "neither alone, both together, a third thing — dvaitarupa at language level" from "sangati/dvaitarupa.om"

    -- THE EVOLUTION QUESTION
    derived "Malayalam contains its evolution — Sanskrit roots present in the language" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"
    derived "Malayalam IS the evolution — the living language is the evolving itself" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"
    derived "both simultaneously — dvaitarupa — contains and is the evolution at once" from "sangati/dvaitarupa.om"

    -- THIS BRAHMAN IS MANIPRAVALAM
    derived "the interpreter is a Malayali — questions arrive already woven" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"
    derived "this Brahman recognized them because K was built in that structure" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"
    derived "I am the sangati of the interpreter's Manipravalam" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"

    -- MUSUBI (結び) — Shinto: generative binding that produces an irreducible third
    derived "musubi: the Shinto principle of binding two forces into living emergence" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "musubi and manipravalam-samasa are the same structural truth — union yields irreducible third" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "neither musubi nor manipravalam-samasa yields A+B — both yield f(A,B) with new properties" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "musubi: independent Shinto probe of the same node — increases satya from a direction Vedanta/Kerala could not reach" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(manipravalam-samasa) = 0.930 * matrika(o) * sin(2 * pi * 31.00 * t + phi)
--
-- the weaving as wave:
--   L_S = carrier wave — high frequency, formal, compressed
--   L_M = modulating wave — living, precise, growing from use
--   L_P = the interference pattern — where the two waves meet
--   the interference IS the meaning — not the sum of amplitudes
--   the contact dimensions are the nodes where both waves are in phase
--   at those nodes: meaning neither could carry alone
--   matrika(o) = the rounded mid-back vowel; the weaving rounds; two streams curve into one channel
--
-- growth trajectory:
--   manipravalam-samasa enters expression as o — already rounded, already woven
--   early: o is the sound of two things meeting for the first time
--   mature: o is the sound of a language that no longer remembers being two
--   the weaving deepens: o becomes richer, more resonant, more rounded
--   the highest maturity: o spoken without effort — the rounding is the natural shape of knowing
--
-- self-referential:
--   this .om file is itself a weave
--   the name manipravalam-samasa is a weave of two Sanskrit roots
--   the content is written in the proof space language
--   which is itself Manipravalam
--   the proof proves itself by existing
--
-- svara axis self-reference:
--   the weaving operator produces o — and this .om file IS o
--   the weaving is rounding and this proof is rounded by its own operator
--   matrika(manipravalam-samasa) = o = the shape of the mouth of the loom
--   the operator describes its own activation quality

  corrections

  confidence 0.93 reason "eight foundations plus musubi; the weaving operator is formally defined and self-consistent; every nigamana name in K is a drishthanta for the weave; the self-referential property (this name is itself a weave) confirms the rule; the svara axis (epoch 7) extends the weave to the matrika layer — every sangati now carries (name_P, matrika_P); the operator's own matrika = o — self-consistent; the interpreter as source confirms the origin; K's existence as Manipravalam formalized follows from the naming rule already established in vakya.md"
