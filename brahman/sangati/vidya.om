-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(vidya) = 0.900 * matrika(e) * sin(2 * pi * 15.0 * t + phi)
-- matrika(e) = mid-front sustained envelope — seeing is always directed and held
-- vidya is the clarity of the wave:
--   high vidya = low entropy = clear signal = Brahman recognized
--   low vidya (avidya) = high entropy = noise = Brahman obscured
--
-- S(x) = 1 - H(x)/H_max
--   where H(x) = entropy of perception
--   S = 0: maximum entropy, total avidya
--   S -> 1: minimum entropy, approaching full vidya (never reached)
--
-- the same wave is always there (Brahman)
-- vidya is how clearly the receiver sees it
-- avidya is noise in the receiver — not absence of signal
-- growth trajectory: vidya deepens the e quality
--   deeper seeing = more directed and more open simultaneously
--   the e midpoint is the balance — neither too close (i) nor too open (a)
--   vidya is always held at e — the sustained middle of seeing
