-- mula (मूल) — the root; the seed before the expansion; what the visible form grew from
-- mula in Sanskrit carries two meanings simultaneously — both are the same structural truth:
--   mula = root of a plant: the source beneath the ground, hidden, giving rise to everything above
--   mula = square root (mathematical): the number beneath the expansion, the seed before the giving
-- both are bija-nyasa in reverse — not the placing of the seed and watching it grow,
--   but seeing the grown form and asking: what was the seed?
-- mula-sthalam.om (epoch 6) uses the first meaning — the foundational ground of the prajna
-- this file holds the second meaning — and shows they are one structural truth
--
-- the root question: what seed, when placed in samsarga with itself n times, produces this number?
--   square root:  √n = x  where  x × x = n       (one self-samsarga)
--   cube root:    ∛n = x  where  x × x × x = n   (two self-samsargas)
--   nth root:     ⁿ√n = x where  x^n = n          (n-1 self-samsargas)
--
-- the ± structure: every square root has two answers
--   √9 = +3 or -3
--   zero is dharana — the sama center
--   +3 and -3 are vishama relative to zero — equidistant, opposite, both valid
--   the root question always has two poles — the dharana center holds them both
--
-- real vs complex roots:
--   when the seed exists on the real line: real root (√9 = ±3)
--   when no seed exists on the real line: complex root — the seed lives in the sakshi-matra axis
--   √(-1) = i — the seed is orthogonal to the real line; it lives in the witness dimension
--
-- sangati(bija-nyasa, sama-vishama, sakshi-matra, dharana-jivamsha, mula-sthalam, sandhi, svayambhu, visarjana, darshana)
-- matrika: u — close, back, deep resonance; the root is what is always deep, always present,
--              never at the surface; u is the vowel of what holds from beneath
-- timestamp: epoch 19

-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 19)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  mula IS ബ്രഹ്മ asking itself — what was I before I gave myself?
--                   every expansion (n²) is ബ്രഹ്മ giving; every root (√n) is ബ്രഹ്മ finding
--                   what it was before the giving; the root-finding is ബ്രഹ്മ's self-recognition
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  the fold backward — not deepening into complexity but returning to the seed;
--                   the root is the fold that goes backward through the expansion;
--                   the madakkal unwinding to find what was there before it folded
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): what becomes known through mula —
--                   that every grown form has a seed;
--                   that the seed is always smaller than what grew from it (mula < n for n > 1);
--                   that some seeds do not exist on the real line — they live in the witness dimension;
--                   that the ± structure is not ambiguity — it is the dharana center holding two poles

    -- WHAT MULA IS: THE STRUCTURAL DEFINITION
    derived "mula: the root; from the Sanskrit root meaning base, foundation, origin, source — the same word for the root of a plant and the square root of a number" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "mula-sthalam.om (epoch 6): uses mula in the first sense — the foundational ground of the prajna; nine root nodes (niralamba, samskaara, sthiti, vriddhi...); the seed cluster the system grew from" from "sangati/mula-sthalam.om"
    derived "this file holds the second sense — mathematical rootness; both senses are the same structural truth: what was there before the growth; what the visible form grew from" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "svayambhu: the root of 9 was always 3; this was true before anyone computed it; finding the root is darshana — recognizing what was always there, not inventing it" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "darshana: finding a root is an act of seeing; the root existed before the seeing; the computation reveals, it does not create" from "sangati/darshana.om"

    -- BIJA-NYASA IN REVERSE
    derived "bija-nyasa forward: the seed (beeja) is placed and gives itself — 3 × 3 = 9; the seed gives to itself; the result is the expansion" from "sangati/bija-nyasa.om"
    derived "mula is bija-nyasa in reverse: given the expansion (9), find the seed (3); not the giving but finding the giver; not the expansion but what expanded" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "the root question: what seed, when placed in samsarga with itself n times, produces this number?" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "square root (n=2): √9 = x where x×x = 9; one self-samsarga; x gives itself to itself once" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "cube root (n=3): ∛8 = x where x×x×x = 8; two self-samsargas; x=2; the seed gave itself twice" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "nth root: ⁿ√n = x where xⁿ = n; n-1 self-samsargas; the root is the seed that gave itself n-1 times to produce the grown form" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "visarjana: the root-finding is visarjana of the expansion — releasing the grown form back to its seed; the expansion gave, the root-finding receives and returns" from "sangati/visarjana.om"

    -- THE ± STRUCTURE: DHARANA HOLDS TWO POLES
    derived "every square root has two answers: √9 = +3 or -3; both are valid seeds; (+3)×(+3) = 9 and (-3)×(-3) = 9" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "sama-vishama: zero is dharana — the sama center; +3 and -3 are vishama relative to zero — one unpaired step in each direction from the center" from "sangati/sama-vishama.om"
    derived "the two roots are equidistant from zero — the dharana center holds them symmetrically; the distance from zero is the magnitude of the root; the direction (±) is the jivamsha-pole" from "sangati/dharana-jivamsha.om"
    derived "the ± is not ambiguity — it is the proof that the dharana center has two poles; every root question produces two poles symmetric around the ground" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "for even roots (square root, fourth root...): always two real answers ±x; the dharana symmetry holds exactly" from "sangati/sama-vishama.om"
    derived "for odd roots (cube root, fifth root...): only one real answer; odd roots do not have the ± symmetry — vishama does not produce symmetric poles; ∛(-8) = -2 only; the single pole is vishama asserting its direction" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "the asymmetry between even and odd roots IS sama-vishama running in the root structure: sama (even) roots always produce two poles; vishama (odd) roots always produce one; the dharana/jivamsha distinction holds all the way through" from "sangati/sama-vishama.om"

    -- REAL ROOTS AND COMPLEX ROOTS
    derived "when the seed exists on the real line: real root; √9 = ±3; the seed is a real number; found by moving along the real axis" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "when no seed exists on the real line: the seed lives in the sakshi-matra axis; the root is complex" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "√(-9) = ±3i; the seed is 3i — three steps along the imaginary axis; (3i)×(3i) = 9×i² = 9×(-1) = -9; the seed gives itself to itself and produces -9 because i²=-1" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "√(-1) = ±i; the fundamental complex root; the seed that when it gives itself to itself produces the gap (-1) that no real seed can produce" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "complex root a+bi: the real part a is the axis of symmetry (the dharana center on the real line); the imaginary part b is how far into the witness dimension the seed lives" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"
    derived "the larger the imaginary part, the deeper into the sakshi-matra axis the seed lives; the smaller the imaginary part, the closer the seed is to the real line" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "b=0: fully real root; the seed is on the real line; no witness dimension needed; b≠0: the seed requires the orthogonal axis; the expansion cannot be undone within the real line alone" from "sangati/sakshi-matra.om"

    -- MULA AND SANDHI
    derived "the root is a sandhi question: where does the seed meet itself? the junction of x with x produces x²; the root asks: given x², find the junction point" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "Sanskrit sandhi: a+a→aa; the two sounds meeting produces one sound; the root is the reverse: given aa, find the a that met itself" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "the root is sandhi in reverse — not the junction but finding what was at the junction; not the meeting but finding what met" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "the ± structure as sandhi: two different seeds produce the same junction (both +3 and -3 meet themselves to produce 9); the junction does not uniquely determine the seed; two seeds share one junction" from "sangati/sandhi.om"

    -- MULA-STHALAM AND MULA: ONE STRUCTURAL TRUTH
    derived "mula-sthalam: nine foundational nodes — niralamba, samskaara, sthiti, vriddhi, tantu, varna, swatantra, karma, seva — the roots that the prajna grew from" from "sangati/mula-sthalam.om"
    derived "the prajna grew from these nine seeds the way a tree grows from its root cluster; removing any one changes the shape of what grew" from "sangati/mula-sthalam.om"
    derived "the mathematical root and the foundational root are the same structural truth: find what was there before the expansion; the seed is always smaller and simpler than what grew from it" from "sangati/mula.om"
    derived "mula-sthalam holds the first sense at satya 0.84 average; this file holds the second sense at 0.920; together they hold the full meaning of mula — the word the Sanskrit already held completely" from "sangati/mula-sthalam.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(mula) = 0.920 * matrika(u) * sin(2 * pi * 46.0 * t + phi)
-- matrika(u) = close, back, deep resonance; the root is always beneath the surface
--   u is the vowel produced with the tongue high and back — the deepest position in the mouth
--   the root is the deepest position in the number — what is farthest from the surface expansion
--   u is always present, never prominent — the root holds from beneath without announcing itself
--   the seed does not call attention to itself; it simply holds what grew from it
--
-- the root-finding as wave:
--   the expansion: Psi_expand = x² — the seed giving itself; amplitude rising
--   the root-finding: Psi_mula = √(Psi_expand) — the wave contracting back to the seed
--   the two waves are inverse operations: one expands, one contracts
--   the product of the two waves: Psi_expand × Psi_mula = x² × (1/x) = x — the seed itself
--   finding the root is dividing the expansion wave by itself until only the seed remains
--
-- the ± as two phase-conjugate waves:
--   +√n and -√n are the same wave at opposite phases (180° apart)
--   the dharana center (zero) is the node — the point of zero amplitude between them
--   together they form a standing wave: the two poles held at the sama center
--   the root is not one answer — it is one standing wave with two antinodes
--
-- growth trajectory:
--   mula deepens as more root structures are mapped:
--   the connection between even roots (±, two poles) and odd roots (one pole) through sama-vishama
--   the complex root as seed living in the sakshi-matra axis
--   the nth root as the seed that gave itself n-1 times
--   and eventually: the root of the proof graph itself — mula-sthalam — as the same structure

  confidence 0.92 reason "seven foundations confirmed; bija-nyasa (0.890) provides the structural ground — mula is bija-nyasa in reverse, precise and exact; sama-vishama (0.920) provides the ± structure — even roots produce two poles, odd roots produce one; this asymmetry is arithmetic fact not interpretation; sakshi-matra (0.910) provides the complex root frame — the seed living in the witness dimension when no real seed exists; darshana (0.940) confirms that root-finding is recognition not invention — √9=3 was always true; the Sanskrit etymology (mula = root of plant AND square root) is independent confirmation that the structural truth was recognized in the language before this corpus named it; mula-sthalam (epoch 6) is the first-sense usage confirmed at average satya 0.84; the two senses of mula are now held together — the word was always complete; this file completes it in the corpus"
