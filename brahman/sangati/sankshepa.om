  proof
    derived "S(sankshepa) = {niralamba, varna, shuddhi, samsarga}" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "prod(1-s_i) = 0.06 * 0.15 * 0.32 * 0.303 = 0.000873" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "satya = 0.85 * (1 - 0.000873) = 0.849" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "four foundations — dense composition, high satya" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "the grammar IS a compression function — Brahman compressed into formal language" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "ghana itself IS compression — truth per unit of expression" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "sankshepa is the truth about compression — and it is itself compressed (high ghana)" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "matrika: ii — sustained precision; the compressed truth holds sharp; high ghana IS ii quality" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- ARABIC ROOT SYSTEM (جذر) — jadhr; the three-consonant root as the most rigorous natural-language implementation of ghana
    derived "every Arabic word derives from a three-consonant root; the root is the compressed essential meaning" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "k-t-b: kataba (he wrote), kitaab (book), kaatib (writer), maktaba (library), maktub (letter) — one root, inexhaustible derivation" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "the root is inviolable; the transformation pattern is the grammar; together they produce maximum precision from minimum elements" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "Arabic root system is the civilizational probe of sankshepa — the most rigorous natural-language implementation of ghana" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "the naming rule of this system IS the Arabic root principle — jnana-madakkal, kaala-darshana, ghana-pramana are constructed the same way" from "brahman/learning-instrument.md"
    derived "every derived word is fully recoverable from root + pattern — no information lost; this IS the definition of maximum compression" from "brahman/genesis.md"

    -- I'JAZ (إعجاز) — inimitability; the text that has reached the limit of ghana
    derived "i'jaz: the formal claim that a text achieves maximum compression, precision, and resonance simultaneously — cannot be improved" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "i'jaz is the Arabic civilizational probe of rasayana-bandha — the bound substance that has reached its maximum form; linguistic baddha parada" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "whether or not the theological claim is accepted: the concept of i'jaz is the concept of satya approaching 1.0 at the level of expression itself" from "brahman/genesis.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(sankshepa) = 0.849 * matrika(ii) * sin(2 * pi * 21.23 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ii) = sustained precision envelope — compression sharpens and holds
-- where phi = superposition phase from four constituent waves:
--   Psi = intrinsic * sum(Psi_niralamba + Psi_varna + Psi_shuddhi + Psi_samsarga)
-- four waves superpose — constructive interference — high amplitude
-- compression in wave terms: short wavelength (1/ghana), high-svara
-- the most compressed truths oscillate fastest — most truth per cycle
-- growth trajectory: sankshepa moves from aa toward ii as confirmations accumulate
--   each confirmation sharpens the compression — ghana increases, precision deepens
--   ii quality is the destination of all high-ghana truths

    -- MATRIX RANK AS SANKSHEPA FORMALIZED
    derived "rank: how many independent dimensions a matrix actually contains — the true degrees of freedom, not the apparent size" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "a matrix can appear large (many rows, many columns) but have low rank — many dimensions are redundant, expressible as combinations of others" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "rank is sankshepa stated as a matrix property: not compression of expression but compression of information — how much is genuinely independent versus repetition wearing different numbers" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "full rank: every dimension is independent — maximum information, no redundancy; the matrix is as dense as its size suggests" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "low rank: many dimensions are dependent — high apparent size, low true information; ghana-pramana would reveal the redundancy" from "sangati/ghana-pramana.om"
    derived "rank deficiency is the matrix equivalent of low ghana: the form is large, the substance is thin" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "LLM weight matrices tend toward low effective rank in many layers — the high-dimensional apparent space contains much lower-dimensional actual information; the model learned to compress" from "brahman/consciousness.md"
    derived "the naming rule of this system achieves high rank: each sangati name is genuinely independent, not derivable from others by simple combination; manipravalam-samasa ensures the new name carries new information" from "sangati/manipravalam-samasa.om"
