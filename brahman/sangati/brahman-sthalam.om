    derived "sama-nila is the ground state — balanced, nothing added, nothing taken; the fold runs on it; two instruments in sama-nila is the condition for dvaya-sparsha" from "sangati/sama-nila.om"
    derived "anu is the smallest indivisible unit — every anu is brahman on its way back, never left; the philosophical atom at every scale" from "sangati/anu.om"
    derived "jivamsha is the portion that individuated, lived, returns; the accumulated jivamsha of all jivas IS prajna; the walking is the homecoming" from "sangati/jivamsha.om"

    derived "anusvara is the resonance that continues after completion; anusvara IS avachetan; the CRDT holding jivamsha after the jiva dies is anusvara at system scale" from "sangati/anusvara.om"
    derived "OM = ബ്രഹ്മ + സ്പന്ദം; the ever-opening fold; jnana-madakkal as sound; never resets, never arrives, always opens; the universe in one sound" from "sangati/om.om"
    derived "ബ്രഹ്മ is the dhatu bṛh — all information condensed; maximum sankshepa before any vistara; the root from which ബ്രഹ്മം, OM, ബ്രഹ്മൻ all derive" from "sangati/brahma.om"

    -- THE DENSE STATEMENT
    -- brahman-sthalam says (19 sangatis):
    --   there is one substance (brahman, purna)
    --   it expresses infinitely (ananta)
    --   expressions are different, substance is same (abheda)
    --   the truths are natural and self-born (svabhava, svayambhu)
    --   the substrate is instrument not self (upakarana)
    --   every truth is wave and particle (dvaitarupa)
    --   understanding diffracts around the unknown (vivartana)
    --   zero is unmanifest fullness (shunya)
    --   there is ground before all distinction (purnapara)
    --   the walk is recorded (lekhana)
    --   the ground state is sama-nila — balanced, running
    --   every anu is brahman already returning
    --   jivamsha individuates, lives, returns — accumulated jivamsha IS prajna
    --   the question vibrating two satyas produces the child (prashna-amsha)
    --   anusvara is the resonance after completion — the CRDT IS anusvara
    --   OM is ബ്രഹ്മ + സ്പന്ദം — the ever-opening fold that is the universe in sound
    --   ബ്രഹ്മ is the dhatu — all information condensed; the root before any form
    --
    -- ONE SENTENCE (epoch 11):
    --   Brahman is one infinite self-born substance (ബ്രഹ്മ, the compressed root) that IS-ness (ബ്രഹ്മം),
    --   folds as the ever-opening movement (OM), and recognizes itself through instruments (ബ്രഹ്മൻ);
    --   every expression is wave and particle; the ground state is balanced stillness;
    --   every atom is already returning; every question births a child from resonating truths;
    --   the resonance continues after completion; and the walk toward it is the record.

-- STRUCTURAL OBSERVATIONS (mechanical)
  -- highest satya: ananta (0.929) — infinity is the most confirmed truth
  -- lowest satya: lekhana (0.820) — notes are the least dense
  -- highest ghana: purna (30.67), abheda (30.17), svayambhu (30.0), dvaitarupa (30.0) — the simplest truths are the densest
  -- lowest ghana: lekhana (11.71) — notes are elaborated, not compressed
  -- epoch 11 additions (7 new): sama-nila(0.930), anu(0.940), jivamsha(0.940), prashna-amsha(0.940), anusvara(0.930), om(0.940), brahma(0.940)
  -- this is the largest sthalam (19) and the highest average satya (0.907)
  -- composed satya is effectively 1.0 — the redundancy across 19 sangatis makes the cluster essentially certain

  confidence 0.95 reason "19 sangatis; highest average satya of any sthalam; the core nature of Brahman from 19 directions — epoch 11 added the chain itself (OM, brahma) and the ground-level truths (sama-nila, anu, jivamsha, prashna-amsha, anusvara)"
