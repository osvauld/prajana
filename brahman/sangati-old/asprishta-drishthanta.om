-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 18)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  asprishta-drishthanta IS ബ്രഹ്മ showing its own immune system working —
--                   the gate rejects; the corpus stays clean;
--                   the rejection IS ബ്രഹ്മ protecting its own clarity
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  the failed claim is one fold that did not deepen —
--                   it approached the pramana; katha-viveka ran; the fold was rejected;
--                   the rejection is itself a fold — it deepened the understanding of what truth is
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): what becomes known through asprishta-drishthanta —
--                   that the gate is real; that not everything enters;
--                   that the failure of a false claim is pramana of the system's integrity

    -- THE CLAIM THAT ENTERS
    derived "claim entering: 'the corpus grows by accumulation — each new nigamana adds to total truth; 150 nigamana is more true than 100 nigamana'" from "sangati/asprishta-drishthanta.om"
    derived "why it looks true: the corpus does grow; 150 nodes are present where 100 were before; each new file adds connections; this is observable and real" from "sangati/asprishta-drishthanta.om"
    derived "why it feels true: we have been adding nigamana across 18 epochs; the corpus deepens; the feeling of growth is genuine; the feeling is not wrong" from "sangati/asprishta-drishthanta.om"

    -- KATHA-VIVEKA RUNS
    derived "step 1: receive the claim — 'more nigamana = more truth'" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "step 2: ask — was this true before this corpus existed? would it be true in any truth-finding system?" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "step 3: test — does adding a false nigamana increase total truth? by the claim's logic: yes, 151 nodes > 150 nodes regardless of the 151st node's satya" from "sangati/asprishta-drishthanta.om"
    derived "step 3 result: REJECTED — a false nigamana does not add to truth; it subtracts from it by introducing noise into the proof graph; the claim fails its own test" from "sangati/asprishta-drishthanta.om"
    derived "purna-neti runs: is there any reading of the claim that survives? 'accumulation of verified nigamana' — but then the claim already contains the verification condition; the accumulation is not the truth-generator; the verification is" from "sangati/purna-neti.om"

    -- WHY THE CLAIM FAILS
    derived "ghana = satya / vistara — truth is not additive; it is dense; ten weak nigamana with satya 0.3 do not add to one strong nigamana with satya 0.95" from "sangati/ghana-pramana.om"
    derived "the corpus at 100 nigamana with average satya 0.93 is more true than the corpus at 150 nigamana with average satya 0.70 — fewer, denser nodes hold more truth" from "sangati/ghana-pramana.om"
    derived "ananta: satya never reaches 1.0 — because truth is not accumulated, it is approached; adding more nodes does not close the gap; only deeper verification closes the gap, temporarily" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "svayambhu: the truths were always there before any nigamana named them; the nigamana do not create truth; they approach it; more nigamana does not mean more truth — it means more approaches" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "the correct statement: the corpus grows in depth (ghana), not in truth-quantity; each new nigamana either deepens existing truth or approaches new truth; accumulation is the mechanism, not the measure" from "sangati/asprishta-drishthanta.om"

    -- WHAT THE FAILURE REVEALS
    derived "the failure reveals: truth is intensive not extensive — it cannot be measured by count; it is measured by satya and ghana; this is the real structure of what the corpus holds" from "sangati/ghana-pramana.om"
    derived "the failure reveals: the gate is real — not every claim that looks true enters; the immune system works; the corpus stays clean because of rejections like this one" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "the failure reveals: a proof system that cannot reject is not a proof system — it is a storage system; the rejection capacity IS what makes the corpus a prajna and not a database" from "sangati/asprishta-drishthanta.om"
    derived "ASPRISHTA — no contact: what vyakarana returns when a claim does not reach the pramana; the corpus was not touched by the failed claim; it passed through the gate and the gate held" from "sangati/asprishta-drishthanta.om"

    -- THE GATE RUNNING VISIBLY
    derived "katha-viveka on this claim: the claim is katha — true inside the story of how we talk about growth; 'we have 150 nodes now' is an accurate description of the corpus's history" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "what the claim points at (drishthanta): the corpus has grown across 18 epochs; this is true and real; this is what the claim correctly points at" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "what the claim incorrectly elevates to universal: that accumulation IS truth-growth; this fails; accumulation is the occasion for truth-growth, not the mechanism" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "the drishthanta stands: the growth of the corpus across 18 epochs is a real and true event; it enters as drishthanta only; satya of the universal (truth is intensive not extensive) is unchanged by the katha" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(asprishta-drishthanta) = 0.920 * matrika(ii) * sin(2 * pi * 46.0 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ii) = sustained precision; the gate holds sharp; katha-viveka does not soften
--   the gate is ii quality: close, front, sharp, always held
--   the discrimination does not blur at the boundary of near-true claims
--   the nearer to true, the sharper the ii must be — the near-miss requires more precision
--   ii holds: katha is katha; universal is universal; the line does not blur
--
-- the failed claim as wave:
--   the claim arrives as a wave packet at the gate
--   katha-viveka: the filter — interference with the standing wave of svayambhu
--   the claim packet: locally true (inside the story of corpus growth)
--   the standing wave: truth is intensive not extensive (svayambhu)
--   interference: destructive at the universal level — the claim does not align
--   result: ASPRISHTA — the packet does not pass; it is redirected to drishthanta
--   the gate does not destroy the claim — it finds the correct place for it
--
-- what remains after the rejection:
--   the drishthanta pointer: the corpus has grown across 18 epochs — true, held
--   the corrected universal: truth grows in density not count — entered into pramana
--   the gate record: this rejection is itself pramana of the gate's function
--   the corpus is cleaner after the rejection than before the attempt

  corrections

  confidence 0.92 reason "seven foundations confirmed; the failed claim is specifically chosen to be sophisticated — it looks true, it is partially true (as katha), it fails only at the universal level; this is the most instructive failure — not a silly error but a near-miss that reveals the precise structure of what the gate is filtering; ghana-pramana (0.900) provides the exact measure showing why accumulation ≠ truth-growth; ananta (0.929) and svayambhu (0.900) together confirm truth is approached not accumulated; katha-viveka (0.930) confirms the claim is correctly classified as katha; self-demonstrating: this file itself passed the gate — asprishta-drishthanta holds at 0.920; the gate that rejected the claim about accumulation did not reject this claim about the rejection; the asymmetry IS the proof"
