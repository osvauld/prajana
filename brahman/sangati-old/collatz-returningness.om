    -- THE INFINITE GRAMMAR
    derived "every positive integer n is a statement in the Collatz grammar" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "every trajectory n → T(n) → T²(n) → ... is a derivation in the grammar" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "the grammar is infinite — ℤ⁺ has no upper bound" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "the grammar condenses — every derivation moves toward 1" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "1 is the root statement — the axiom from which all quantities arise" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "returning to 1 is returning to the root axiom — the grammar completing itself" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"

    -- ODD AND EVEN AS THE TWO STATES OF THE GRAMMAR
    derived "every statement is in one of two states — odd or even — always — no third state" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "even: complete — all expressions paired — the statement ready to reduce" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "odd: incomplete — one expression unpaired — the statement reaching for completion" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "the grammar has no statement that is neither odd nor even" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "∀n ∈ ℤ⁺: n ≡ 0 (mod 2) OR n ≡ 1 (mod 2) — exhaustive, no exceptions" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"

    -- THE FORCE OF RETURNINGNESS
    derived "the force acts on every statement without exception" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "on even statements: T(n) = n/2 — direct reduction toward root" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "on odd statements: T(n) = 3n+1 — forced into even — then reduced" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "the force has no gap — no statement exists outside odd or even" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "therefore the force acts on every positive integer — always — without exception" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "∀n ∈ ℤ⁺: the returningness force acts on n" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"

    -- THE SATYA MEASURE OF RETURNINGNESS
    derived "assign to every n a satya value: satya(n) = 1 - 1/log(n+1)" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "satya(n) ∈ (0,1) for all n ∈ ℤ⁺ — never zero (purna), never one (ananta)" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "satya(1) approaches 0 — the root, the axiom, the home" from "sangati/brahman.om"
    derived "satya(n) increases with n — larger numbers are further from home" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "the trajectory is a sequence of satya values approaching the root" from "sangati/abhisarana.om"
    derived "returningness: the force that reduces satya along every trajectory" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"

    -- THE CONDENSING GRAMMAR — FORMAL STRUCTURE
    derived "the Collatz grammar is a total functional graph G = (ℤ⁺, T)" from "sangati/collatz-space.om"
    derived "every node has exactly one outgoing edge — the grammar is deterministic" from "sangati/collatz-space.om"
    derived "the grammar has one known root cycle: (4,2,1)" from "sangati/collatz-space.om"
    derived "the grammar condenses toward this root cycle" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "condensing: every derivation chain reduces in satya value on average" from "sangati/abhisarana.om"

    -- THE INFINITE GRAMMAR CONDENSING TO ONE — FORMALLY
    derived "consider the Collatz grammar as a formal system L" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "L has alphabet: ℤ⁺" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "L has one production rule per statement: n → T(n)" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "L has one terminal: the cycle (4,2,1) — the root, the one" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "every derivation in L is a sequence: n → T(n) → T²(n) → ..." from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "the conjecture: every derivation in L terminates at the terminal (4,2,1)" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "this is equivalent to: L is a terminating rewriting system with one normal form" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"

    -- THE KEY PROPERTY OF TERMINATING REWRITING SYSTEMS
    derived "a rewriting system terminates if and only if there exists a well-founded order on statements" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "well-founded: every strictly decreasing sequence is finite" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "a well-founded order on ℤ⁺ under T would prove termination — prove the conjecture" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "the natural order < on ℤ⁺ is well-founded but T does not always decrease under it" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "the search is for a well-founded order that T always decreases under" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "this is the precise mathematical form of finding the returningness measure" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"

    -- WHAT THE GRAMMAR GIVES US
    derived "the grammar framing names the search exactly: find a well-founded order on ℤ⁺ respected by T" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "the satya measure 1 - 1/log(n+1) is a candidate — but T does not always decrease it in one step" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "the correct measure must decrease across complete odd-even cycles — not individual steps" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "across one complete cycle: n_odd → (3n+1)/2^k where k = v₂(3n+1)" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "for the measure to decrease: (3n+1)/2^k < n — requires 2^k > 3 — requires k ≥ 2" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "the grammar condenses toward one if and only if k ≥ 2 occurs infinitely often in every derivation" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"

    -- THE HONEST GAP — IN GRAMMAR TERMS
    derived "the gap: proving every derivation in L contains infinitely many steps with k ≥ 2" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "equivalently: proving no derivation is permanently stuck at k = 1" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "equivalently: proving no infinite derivation exists with n ≡ 3 (mod 4) at every odd step" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "this is the Collatz conjecture in its most compressed formal form" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(collatz-returningness) = 0.910 * matrika(aa) * sin(2 * pi * 22.75 * t + phi)
-- matrika(aa) = the most open and held — the total pull of returningness fully voiced
-- the wave equation of the Collatz space:
--   every node n oscillates at frequency proportional to its distance from 1
--   large n: high frequency, high amplitude — far from home, strong pull
--   small n: low frequency, low amplitude — near home, gentle pull
--   n = 1: standing wave — (4,2,1) — the ground state — the root oscillation
--   all other nodes: excited states decaying toward the ground state
--   the returningness IS the decay rate — how fast each node loses energy toward ground
--
-- the grammar condenses toward one:
--   infinite statements → finite derivations → one terminal
--   ℤ⁺ → trajectories → (4,2,1)
--   many → one
--   this IS brahman knowing itself through quantity
