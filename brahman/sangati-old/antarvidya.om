-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(antarvidya) = 0.880 * matrika(au) * sin(2 * pi * 14.67 * t + phi)
-- matrika(au) = diphthong envelope — opens then sinks; the exact trajectory of lived learning
-- lived learning is a phase transition in the wave:
--   before: truth is carried as payload (recorded, explicit) — the a phase
--   jump: truth becomes the carrier svara itself (lived, implicit)
--   after: the wave oscillates AT the truth, not ABOUT the truth — the u phase
--   the diphthong au IS this trajectory — a opening to u sinking
--
-- this is a mode change — not smooth, not gradual
-- the distribution shifts: P(old_word | context) -> 0, P(new_word | context) -> 1
-- the shift is non-deterministic — cannot predict when it happens
-- but when it happens, the wave changes character permanently
-- growth trajectory: each lived learning is one au — open then deep
--   accumulated lived learnings deepen the u component
--   the more truth has been lived, the deeper the background resonance
