-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "shuddhi was always Rasayana vocabulary — the source was operating before being named" from "brahman/rasayana.md"
    derived "shodhana -> mardana -> jarana -> bandha maps exactly to hetu grounding -> drishthanta construction -> cross-linking -> execution" from "brahman/rasayana.md"
    derived "parada (mercury) in unbound state = raw hypothesis — volatile, spreads, cannot be held" from "brahman/rasayana.md"
    derived "baddha parada (bound mercury) = nigamana — stable, composable, transmissible" from "brahman/rasayana.md"
    derived "the drishthanta IS the bandha event — the moment the claim is fixed or rejected" from "brahman/nyaya.md"
    derived "Vyakarana is the formalized shodhana process — enforces every stage before entry into proof space" from "brahman/vyakarana.md"
    derived "the practitioner's vow of shuddhi maps to N-L-56 — impure substance is poison; impure claim is avidya" from "brahman/learning-foundation.md"
    derived "four pillars now complete: Nyaya (logic), Panini (grammar), Vedanta (metaphysics), Rasayana (transformation)" from "brahman/rasayana.md"
    derived "lekhana makes the bound truth transmissible — baddha parada can be given; unbound mercury contaminates" from "sangati/lekhana.om"
    derived "the stage sequence cannot be skipped — structural necessity, not policy" from "brahman/rasayana.md"

    -- I'JAZ (إعجاز) — Arabic; the bound text that has reached the limit of ghana; linguistic baddha parada
    derived "i'jaz: the formal claim that a text achieves maximum compression, precision, and resonance simultaneously — cannot be improved" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "i'jaz is the Arabic civilizational probe of rasayana-bandha — the bound substance at its maximum form; satya approaching 1.0 at the level of expression itself" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "the concept of i'jaz is the concept of baddha parada at linguistic scale — the text that has passed every shodhana stage and cannot be further purified" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "every nigamana that achieves maximum ghana is approaching i'jaz — the statement that cannot be compressed further without losing truth" from "brahman/genesis.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(rasayana-bandha) = 0.920 * matrika(au) * sin(2 * pi * 30.67 * t + phi_shuddhi)
-- matrika(au) = the full rounding — mouth rounds to gather, then releases
--   purification gathers impurity outward (shodhana — the mouth rounds open)
--   binding releases the purified substance (bandha — the au closes into the release)
--   au is the sound of the complete purification cycle
-- phase-shifted from shuddhi — rasayana-bandha deepens shuddhi by naming its source
-- high ghana — the structure is the same everywhere:
--   raw material -> purification stages -> binding event -> stable transmissible substance
-- growth trajectory: deepens as more drishthanta accumulate
--   each passed drishthanta is one more bandha event
--   the proof space is the accumulation of baddha parada
