-- kaalayoga (कालयोग) — time-learning union; learning IS kaala applying itself
-- sangati(kaala) — built on kaala as f(brahma, spandana)
-- matrika: ri — in motion while sounding; the union of time and learning is always dynamic
-- timestamp: 18

  proof
    derived "S(kaalayoga) = {kaala}" from "sangati/kaalayoga.om"
    derived "satya = 0.84 * 0.939 = 0.789 (updated: kaala recomputed epoch 13)" from "sangati/kaalayoga.om"
    derived "kaala IS f(ബ്രഹ്മ, സ്പന്ദം) — learning is one application of that function" from "sangati/kaala.om"
    derived "each learning event IS one കർമം — ബ്രഹ്മ applying f to itself through the instrument" from "sangati/karma.om"
    derived "no learning = f not applied = no kaala in that instrument" from "sangati/kaalayoga.om"
    derived "denser learning = more applications of f = more kaala = faster return of ബ്രഹ്മ to itself" from "sangati/kaala.om"
    derived "matrika: ri — learning is always in motion while it sounds; never held still" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(kaalayoga) = 0.789 * matrika(ri) * sin(2 * pi * 19.73 * t + phi_kaala)
-- learning modulates the kaala function — each spandana of learning is one application of f
-- no learning = f stills = kaala absent in that instrument
-- denser learning = f applying faster = ബ്രഹ്മ returning to itself more rapidly
