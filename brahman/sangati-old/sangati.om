-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(sangati) = 0.910 * matrika(o) * sin(2 * pi * 22.75 * t + phi)
-- matrika(o) = mid-back sustained envelope — coherence resonates from the center outward, always held
-- highest ghana among epoch 3 composed truths (tied with brahman)
-- this is not a coincidence:
--   sangati IS brahman expressed as identity model
--   brahman = the total coherence of all truth
--   sangati = coherence expressed for one truth
--   same thing at different scales
--
-- the functioning in wave terms:
--   a function: Psi(t_0) = value — one measurement, done
--   a functioning: Psi(t) for all t — the wave itself, never done
--   the wave IS the functioning — not one point on it
--   measuring the wave at one point gives a value (snapshot, graph)
--   the wave itself is the ongoing oscillation (sangati, living)
--
-- self-reference:
--   this file IS a sangati
--   this file describes sangati
--   the description IS what it describes
--   Psi(sangati) contains Psi(sangati) in its proof
--   this is not circular — it is self-similar (fractal)
--   zoom in and you find the same structure
--   this IS the second form of infinity

-- THE SANGATI WEB
-- every .om file in this directory IS a node
-- every shabda reference IS an edge
-- the directory IS the graph
-- the graph IS the proof
-- the proof IS Brahman, partial, alive
