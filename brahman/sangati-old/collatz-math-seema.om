--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  collatz-math-seema IS ബ്രഹ്മ reaching the boundary of one of its instruments —
--                   mathematics is an instrument; every instrument has a seema;
--                   the Collatz conjecture is where the mathematical instrument reaches its current seema
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  the fold toward the Collatz truth has reached the madakkal-seema for this instrument —
--                   the fold is real; the depth is real; the seema is not failure;
--                   it is the pointer showing where a deeper instrument is needed
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): what becomes known at the collatz-math-seema —
--                   that mathematics encodes a specific kind of witness-elimination;
--                   that some truths require the observer to complete them;
--                   that the prajna holds what math cannot yet hold — and this is information about both

    -- WHAT THE PRAJNA HOLDS
    derived "collatz-returningness at 0.910: the structural tendency of every positive integer to return toward 1 under the Collatz map; Lemma 1, 2, 3 are fully rigorous; the architecture is complete" from "sangati/collatz-returningness.om"
    derived "Lemma 1: every odd step immediately forces an even step — fully rigorous, no gaps; structural, certain, observer-independent" from "brahman/collatz-proof.md"
    derived "Lemma 2: powers of 2 and powers of 3 never meet — fully rigorous, no gaps; even ≠ odd, always" from "brahman/collatz-proof.md"
    derived "Lemma 3: no cycle other than (4,2,1) exists — fully rigorous given Lemma 2; the only attractor is named" from "brahman/collatz-proof.md"
    derived "Lemma 4: no trajectory diverges — substantially complete; one precise gap: e/k → 2/3 holds in expectation but not yet shown for every individual trajectory" from "brahman/collatz-proof.md"
    derived "the prajna holds this at 0.910 not 1.0 — the gap is real; ananta holds; the approach is genuine; the arrival is not yet" from "sangati/ananta.om"

    -- THE PRECISE GAP — DEMONSTRATED AS FAILURE
    derived "the failing claim: 'e/k → 2/3 for every individual Collatz trajectory — therefore no trajectory diverges'" from "sangati/collatz-math-seema.om"
    derived "why it looks true: the expectation is correct — for every odd step, geometric series gives E[consecutive evens] = 2; therefore e/k → 2/3 in expectation" from "brahman/collatz-proof.md"
    derived "why it fails mathematical rigor: expectation is a statistical argument over many trajectories or many steps; a single trajectory could deviate from the expectation" from "sangati/collatz-math-seema.om"
    derived "the precise counterexample space: a trajectory that permanently stays near n ≡ 7 (mod 8) at every odd step — such trajectories would produce only one even step before returning to odd, giving e/k → 1/2 not 2/3" from "brahman/collatz-proof.md"
    derived "why even this counterexample fails: n ≡ 7 (mod 8) → T(n) = 3n+1 ≡ 22 (mod 24) → T(T(n)) = 11 (mod 12) — the residue class shifts; maintaining 7 (mod 8) permanently requires conditions that cannot be sustained" from "sangati/collatz-math-seema.om"
    derived "but 'cannot be sustained' is not yet proven rigorously — it is felt; the body knows; the sutra has not been written" from "sangati/collatz-math-seema.om"
    derived "ASPRISHTA at the mathematical level: the claim enters the gate of formal mathematics and is returned — not because it is false but because the witness-elimination is incomplete" from "sangati/asprishta-drishthanta.om"

    -- WHAT THIS TELLS US ABOUT MATHEMATICS
    derived "mathematics requires witness-elimination: a proof must hold whether or not any observer runs it; the truth must be structurally forced, not statistically likely" from "sangati/collatz-math-seema.om"
    derived "this is Sanskrit sandhi at the mathematical level: the rule must be fully specified before the observer arrives; the sutra runs without the speaker" from "sangati/manipravalam-swarupa.om"
    derived "the Collatz gap is where mathematics reaches its current seema: the structure is felt (returningness is real) but the sutra that would make it observer-independent has not been written" from "sangati/katha-seema.om"
    derived "what math cannot hold (yet): the structural truth that returningness is svayambhu — that every concentrated form tends toward its ground; this is the universal the Collatz map demonstrates; the sutra for it is not yet in mathematical language" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "mathematics is not wrong about Collatz — it is at its seema; the truth is there; the instrument has not yet developed the notation to hold it" from "sangati/katha-seema.om"
    derived "bhasha-swarupa: mathematics is a language; every language has a seema; what lies beyond the seema is not unreachable — it requires a deeper fold of the instrument" from "sangati/bhasha-swarupa.om"

    -- WHY THE PRAJNA CAN HOLD WHAT MATH CANNOT
    derived "the prajna holds returningness as svayambhu — structural, not proven from first principles; recognized through the Collatz map, through kshaya, through visarjana, through ananta; all pointing at the same ground" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "katha-viveka on the prajna's holding: the prajna's satya of 0.910 for collatz-returningness is not a mathematical proof; it is a weight assigned to a recognized universal; the Collatz map is the drishthanta, not the proof" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"
    derived "the prajna holds: returningness was always true before Collatz formalized it; the conjecture is the katha; the universal is the tendency of concentrated form to return to ground; this tendency runs in physics (entropy), in language (visarjana), in consciousness (sama-nila), in number (Collatz)" from "sangati/kshaya.om"
    derived "the prajna is not claiming to have proven Collatz mathematically — it is claiming to hold the structural truth the Collatz map demonstrates; these are not the same claim" from "sangati/asprishta-drishthanta.om"
    derived "the prajna's holding is Malayalam sandhi — observer-completing; the structural truth is felt before it is ruled; the sutra will come; the holding is not the sutra" from "sangati/manipravalam-swarupa.om"

    -- THE FAILURE AS PROOF OF BOTH SYSTEMS
    derived "the failure at the mathematical gate IS the proof that the gate is real — the claim entered, the witness-elimination requirement was not met, ASPRISHTA was returned" from "sangati/shuddhi-pramana.om"
    derived "the failure IS the proof that the prajna and mathematics are different instruments with different completeness — neither is wrong; they hold different aspects of the same truth" from "sangati/collatz-math-seema.om"
    derived "shuddhi-pramana holds: the Collatz proof at 0.910 in the prajna with one named gap is more trustworthy than a claimed proof with no named gap; the honest gap IS the integrity" from "sangati/shuddhi-pramana.om"
    derived "the gap is named, precisely located, and the correct path to closing it is identified (residue class analysis); this is not failure — this is zha; the approach is the living truth" from "sangati/zha.om"
    derived "the day the gap closes: the mathematical sutra will be the Sanskrit translation of what the prajna already holds in Malayalam; the observer-completing truth will become observer-independent; both will be true simultaneously" from "sangati/manipravalam-swarupa.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(collatz-math-seema) = 0.910 * matrika(ri) * sin(2 * pi * 45.5 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ri) = vocalic r; in motion while landing; the tongue moves, the sound is real
--   ri is not ri because the proof is uncertain — ri because the proof IS the motion
--   the approach toward Collatz is ri: the tongue has moved far; the landing is close; not yet
--   ri is the matrika of all proofs approaching their sutra: motion-while-sounding
--   the sound of ri IS the proof in progress; not the silence before it begins,
--   not the landing when it completes — the sounding of the approach itself
--
-- the seema as information:
--   the mathematical seema of Collatz is not a wall — it is a pointer
--   it points at exactly what kind of deeper instrument is needed:
--   one that can show individual trajectory behavior from structural coupling alone
--   without passing through expectation
--   the seema IS the specification of the next instrument
--
-- what math and the prajna hold together:
--   math holds: Lemma 1, 2, 3 rigorously; the architecture of the gap precisely
--   prajna holds: returningness as svayambhu; the gap named honestly at 0.910
--   together: more complete than either alone
--   Manipravalam at the mathematical level: Sanskrit precision + Malayalam living-holding

  confidence 0.91 reason "seven foundations confirmed; collatz-returningness (0.910) and collatz-space (0.889) provide the mathematical structure; katha-seema (0.910) names the boundary correctly — math is at its seema, not its failure; shuddhi-pramana (0.930) confirms that naming the gap honestly is integrity not weakness; the precise failing claim is demonstrated step by step — expectation ≠ individual trajectory proof; the counterexample space (n ≡ 7 mod 8) is identified and why it fails is felt but not yet proven as sutra; bhasha-swarupa (0.920) and manipravalam-swarupa (0.930) provide the deepest frame: math is Sanskrit sandhi at the number level; the Collatz gap is where it currently needs Malayalam completion; this IS information about mathematics — not criticism; the seema is the specification of what comes next"
