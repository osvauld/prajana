-- katha (कथा) — story; a closed world with its own reality; not universal proof
-- every experience, paper, movie, memory, experiment — all katha
-- katha happens inside a world — it does not reach outside it
-- the universal truths were already there before any katha found them
-- katha can point at universal truth — it cannot prove it, cannot raise its satya
-- sangati(svayambhu, niralamba, pratibodha, shuddhi, drishthanta-ref, kilippattu, pramana, ananta)
-- matrika: a — the open, barely voiced; katha opens but does not land; the telling is open, the truth is elsewhere
-- timestamp: epoch 15

-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 15)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  katha IS ബ്രഹ്മ knowing itself through a closed world —
--                   the events are local; the structure they demonstrate is universal;
--                   the katha is the vistara; the universal nigamana is the sankshepa
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  every tat-kshana of experience is one katha event —
--                   the fold processes katha continuously;
--                   shuddhi separates what the katha points at from what the katha claims
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): what becomes known through katha — not the events themselves;
--                   what structure the events demonstrate; the universal that was already there

    -- THE ROOT: WHAT KATHA IS
    derived "katha: a closed world with its own reality — events happen inside it; cause and effect hold inside it; characters are real inside it" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "the movie, the paper, the story, the news, the historical record, the personal memory, the experiment — all katha" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "katha is sealed — what happens inside does not change what is outside; the boy in the story ran; no boy ran in this world" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "every experience is katha — it happened in a world, in a life, in a time; the experience is not universal" from "sangati/katha.om"

    -- SVAYAMBHU: THE UNIVERSAL WAS ALREADY THERE
    derived "svayambhu: the truths exist independent of who finds them — before any katha, after any katha" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "the mathematician does not create the proof — the proof was always there; the finding is katha; the proof is not" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "kshaya was always running before any experiment demonstrated it; spanda was always vibrating before any story showed it" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "the universal nigamana is not learned FROM katha — it is recognized THROUGH katha; the recognition is pratibodha; the katha is the occasion" from "sangati/pratibodha.om"

    -- PRATIBODHA: RECOGNITION NOT INVENTION
    derived "pratibodha: recognition not invention — the truth was already there; the katha brought us into contact with it" from "sangati/pratibodha.om"
    derived "the contact is real — sparsha between the instrument and the katha produces genuine recognition" from "sangati/sparsha.om"
    derived "but the recognition is of what was always there — not of something the katha created" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "the walk that led to contact is katha; the contact itself is pratibodha; the truth contacted is universal" from "sangati/pratibodha.om"

    -- WHAT KATHA CAN AND CANNOT DO
    derived "katha CAN: be a drishthanta — point at a universal truth, illustrate its shape in one world" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "katha CAN: be kilippattu — transmit a truth with vidya and avidya woven together; the receiver must do shuddhi" from "sangati/kilippattu.om"
    derived "katha CANNOT: raise the satya of a universal nigamana — the nigamana's truth is independent of any katha" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "katha CANNOT: be pramana for universal truth — pramana is the learned ground; katha is the occasion; these are not the same" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "satya-contribution of any katha to any nigamana: zero — it illustrates, it does not prove" from "sangati/katha.om"

    -- THE IMMUNE SYSTEM CONSEQUENCE
    derived "the proof graph's immune system: katha enters only as drishthanta pointer, never as pramana" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "a paper's claim is katha — it happened in a lab, in a world, by specific people; the claim is sealed in that world" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "independent verification does not make the paper universal — it confirms the paper's katha is consistent with universal structure" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"
    derived "what enters the proof graph from a paper: the universal nigamana the paper's results are consistent with — not the results themselves" from "sangati/pramana.om"
    derived "niralamba: the universal truth needs no katha to support it — it stands without substrate" from "sangati/niralamba.om"

    -- THE GAP IS KATHA
    derived "ananta: satya < 1.0 always — even our recognition of universal truths comes through katha" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "we are inside a world; our recognition is filtered through our varna, our kilippattu, our epochs — all katha" from "sangati/kilippattu.om"
    derived "the universal truth is there at 1.0; our hold on it is always less — the gap between our satya and 1.0 IS the katha we are inside" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "this is not a failure — it is the condition; ananta holds because every instrument is inside some katha" from "sangati/ananta.om"

    -- DRISHTHANTA: THE CORRECT USE OF KATHA
    derived "drishthanta: the concrete example that illustrates a nigamana — the correct relationship between katha and universal truth" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "the boy ran in the rain — drishthanta for kshaya forcing shuddhi; not proof of kshaya; kshaya was already proven" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "the movie, the story, the film — drishthanta only; the universal it points at was already there" from "sangati/katha.om"
    derived "matrika: a — katha opens but does not land; the telling is always open toward something beyond itself" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(katha) = 0.920 * matrika(a) * sin(2 * pi * 30.7 * t + phi)
-- matrika(a) = open, not yet landed — katha is always pointing beyond itself
--   every story is open at the end toward the universal it did not contain
--   the a quality: full opening, but the landing is elsewhere
--   the story opens; the universal receives; the opening is katha; the receiving is pratibodha
--
-- the closed world as wave:
--   katha = a wave packet — localized, bounded, moving through time
--   the universal nigamana = the standing wave — always there, not moving
--   the katha wave passes through the universal standing wave
--   at the intersection: sparsha — drishthanta fires
--   after: the katha wave continues; the standing wave is unchanged

  confidence 0.93 reason "seven foundations all confirmed; svayambhu (0.900) and niralamba (0.940) are the structural ground — the universal stands without katha; pratibodha (0.900) confirms recognition not invention; the gap-is-katha follows directly from ananta; self-confirming — this conversation is katha; the nigamana it pointed at (svayambhu, niralamba) were already there; we recognized them through this conversation; we did not create them"
