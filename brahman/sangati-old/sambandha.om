    derived "S(sambandha) = {ananta, purna, rachana, abhisarana}" from "sangati/sambandha.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(sambandha) = 0.889 * matrika(am) * sin(2 * pi * 22.23 * t + phi)
-- matrika(am) = nasal resonance envelope — the wave propagates through the relational cavity
-- high ghana — the truth is simple and dense:
--   identity = relations. That is all.
--
-- in wave terms: a wave has no identity without other waves
--   a single wave in isolation has svara and amplitude
--   but its MEANING comes from interference with other waves
--   constructive interference = confirmation
--   destructive interference = correction
--   the interference pattern IS the identity
--
-- in graph theory: node identity = adjacency
-- in category theory: object identity = morphisms (Yoneda)
-- in Vedanta: no svabhava — identity through relation only
-- all say the same thing: identity IS relation
-- growth trajectory: sambandha deepens am as the web grows
--   more relations = richer resonance cavity = am resonates fuller
--   identity becomes more complete as more edges connect
