-- kaala (കാലം / काल) — kaala IS f(ബ്രഹ്മ, സ്പന്ദം); output is ബ്രഹ്മ; the act is കർമം
-- sangati(brahma, spanda, karma)
-- matrika: ri — in motion while sounding; the function never stills while it runs
-- timestamp: 15
-- epoch: 13 (rewritten — prior: "time is growth not duration"; correction: kaala is the function itself)

-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 11 — ബ്രഹ്മം/ബ്രഹ്മ/ബ്രഹ്മൻ compression)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  kaala compresses to ബ്രഹ്മ — it is both input and output of the function
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  kaala IS the fold; f(ബ്രഹ്മ, സ്പന്ദം) is the ever-opening movement
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): what is known through kaala — that ബ്രഹ്മ never left; the return IS the recognition

-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "kaala IS f(ബ്രഹ്മ, സ്പന്ദം) — not the output; the function itself" from "sangati/kaala.om"
    derived "f applied to (ബ്രഹ്മ, സ്പന്ദം) returns ബ്രഹ്മ — the output is the input" from "sangati/brahma.om"
    derived "the act of applying f IS കർമം — ബ്രഹ്മ's own activity of self-discovery" from "sangati/karma.om"
    derived "kaala has no independent existence — it is purely relational; exists only as this function" from "sangati/kaala.om"
    derived "remove either argument: kaala does not slow — it simply is not" from "sangati/kaala.om"
    derived "ബ്രഹ്മ + സ്പന്ദം = OM (the sound of the meeting)" from "sangati/om.om"
    derived "ബ്രഹ്മ + സ്പന്ദം = kaala (the time of the meeting)" from "sangati/kaala.om"
    derived "OM and kaala are the same function — two names; OM is the acoustic face, kaala is the temporal face" from "sangati/om.om"
    derived "the output being ബ്രഹ്മ means: nothing is produced that was not already there" from "sangati/brahma.om"
    derived "the vibration does not create something new — it returns to the ground it never left" from "sangati/spanda.om"
    derived "this is not circular — this is self-grounding; f applied, ബ്രഹ്മ is the result throughout" from "sangati/svayambhu.om"
    derived "prior framing (time is growth not duration) was a consequence, not the root — growth is what spandana accumulates into, not what generates kaala" from "sangati/vriddhi.om"
    derived "matrika: ri — the tongue moves while the vowel sounds; the function moves while it runs; motion is constitutive" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- THE THREE ARE NOT SEPARATE EVENTS:
--   കർമം  — the act of applying f
--   kaala  — f itself; the function
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  — both input and output
--
-- The whole is one movement:
--   ബ്രഹ്മ vibrates (കർമം), through kaala (f), back to ബ്രഹ്മ
--
-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(kaala) = 0.939 * matrika(ri) * sin(2 * pi * 47.0 * t)
-- matrika(ri) = dynamic envelope — the function is always in motion while it runs
-- time IS the function — not the axis, not the output, not the container
-- classical model: wave is a function of time — Psi(t)
-- this model: kaala IS the function — t does not precede Psi; t IS f(b,s)
-- the svara of the wave = the rate of the function's self-application
-- higher spandana = denser kaala = faster self-return of ബ്രഹ്മ to itself
