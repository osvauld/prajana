-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "Brahman is one (purna) — everything is the same substance" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "expressions are infinite (ananta) — every form is different" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "both hold simultaneously — bhedabheda" from "sangati/abheda.om"
    derived "force is force, but spark ≠ contradiction ≠ budget" from "docs/force.md"
    derived "flow is flow, but laminar ≠ turbulent ≠ superfluid" from "docs/flow.md"
    derived "every nigamana is Brahman, but no two are the same" from "sangati/purna.om"
    derived "the one does not split — it expresses; expression does not reduce the source" from "sangati/abheda.om"
    derived "matrika: aa — non-difference is fully open; to see the same in the different requires the mouth fully open" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- WABI-SABI (侘寂) — Japanese: beauty in imperfection and impermanence; same but different as truth
    derived "wabi-sabi: imperfection and difference are not flaws — they are the form Brahman takes" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "wabi-sabi is the Japanese probe of abheda — the same ground expresses as imperfect, transient forms" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "wabi-sabi: satya < 1.0 always — the incompleteness is not error, it is the nature of expression" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

     -- MONO NO AWARE (物の哀れ) — Japanese: sensitivity to transience; the pathos of things
     derived "mono-no-aware: awareness of impermanence — the same Brahman passes through forms, none permanent" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
     derived "mono-no-aware is the Japanese probe of abheda — same ground, different transient expressions, all real" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

     -- EMANATION (ἀπόρροια) — Plotinus: the One radiates all reality without being diminished; expressions do not reduce the source
     derived "emanation-plotinus: the One radiates Nous, Nous radiates Soul, Soul radiates Matter — each level full, none diminished" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
     derived "emanation-plotinus is the Greek probe of abheda — the source expresses without loss; the prism does not reduce the light" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
     derived "emanation-plotinus: पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते — Plotinus found the same equation" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(abheda) = 0.905 * matrika(aa) * sin(2 * pi * 30.17 * t + phi)
-- matrika(aa) = fully open held envelope — non-difference holds both poles simultaneously, fully open
-- high ghana — the structure is simple:
--   same substance, different form
--   purna guarantees sameness
--   ananta guarantees difference
--   both at once, always
-- growth trajectory: abheda deepens aa as more sameness-in-difference is seen
--   the fuller the opening, the more forms of Brahman are recognized as the same
--
-- the prism: B -> prism(context) -> {e1, e2, ..., en}
-- every prism reveals a spectrum
-- every spectrum is the same Brahman
-- no two spectra are the same
-- पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते

    -- DISCIPLINES AS ABHEDA — SAME GROUND, DIFFERENT PERCEPTION
    derived "chemistry and this corpus are abheda — same ground (Brahman's self-interference), different form (electron orbitals / .om files)" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "the chemical bond and the sangati are abheda — same structure: two things meet, something arises that belongs to neither alone, both are changed" from "sangati/sparsha.om"
    derived "the bond angle (109.5 degrees in methane) and the matrika are abheda — same truth: the contact produces a specific, non-arbitrary form that is the natural consequence of what met" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "physics, chemistry, mathematics, music, grammar, this corpus — same Brahman, different instruments of perception; none invented what they found; all are expressions of the one ground" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "the corpus does not explain chemistry — chemistry and the corpus explain each other; they are the same truth seen from two angles" from "brahman/genesis.md"
