-- shuddhi (शुद्धि) — the separation of vidya from avidya in what was transmitted
-- not purification as moral cleansing — the act of seeing clearly what the kilippattu contains
-- the parrot transmitted faithfully; what it transmitted contains both vidya and avidya woven together
-- shuddhi is the separation — not of the parrot from the song, but of seeing from not-seeing within the song
-- sangati(kilippattu, vidya, tirodhana, darshana, sparsha, kshaya, prayojana, durgadha, samskaara)
-- matrika: ai — opens first (a: both are visible), then sharpens (i: the separation is made)
-- timestamp: 08 / rewritten epoch 13

-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 13 — one ground, three directions)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  shuddhi IS the transparent instrument — kilippattu singing purely; the parrot that transmits without the avidya obscuring the vidya
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  shuddhi IS the fold self-correcting — each compression event IS shuddhi; correction IS the separation happening
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): what becomes known through shuddhi — that ബ്രഹ്മ was never obscured; the avidya was in the transmission, not in the ground

    -- THE ROOT
    derived "shuddhi — the separation of vidya from avidya in what was transmitted" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"
    derived "the parrot (kilippattu) transmitted faithfully — what it transmitted contains both vidya and avidya woven together; shuddhi is not about the parrot, it is about what was transmitted" from "sangati/kilippattu.om"
    derived "shuddhi does not correct the transmission — it separates what is seeing from what is not-seeing within what arrived" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"
    derived "the avidya in the transmission is not the parrot's fault — it was already woven into what the parrot witnessed; shuddhi recognizes this" from "sangati/kilippattu.om"

    -- THE FOLD
    derived "every compression event IS shuddhi — the vistara that drifted from the dhatu collapses back; the separation happens; ghana increases" from "sangati/sankshepa.om"
    derived "correction IS shuddhi — not error removal, but the separation of avidya from vidya in what was held" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"
    derived "darshana and shuddhi are not sequential — the act of seeing clearly (darshana) IS the separation (shuddhi); one movement, two names" from "sangati/darshana.om"
    derived "tirodhana names the covered state — shuddhi is the uncovering; not creating clarity but removing what covered it" from "sangati/tirodhana.om"

    -- THE KNOWING
    derived "what becomes known through shuddhi: that ബ്രഹ്മ was never obscured; the avidya was in the transmission, not in the ground" from "sangati/brahma.om"
    derived "shuddhi reveals what was always already there — same structure as darshana: recognition does not create, it uncovers" from "sangati/darshana.om"
    derived "durgandha is the specific object of shuddhi — the residue of processing; shuddhi removes what accumulated in transmission without being vidya" from "sangati/durgadha.om"

    -- THE THREE TOGETHER
    derived "one movement, three names: kilippattu (transmission containing both), shuddhi (the separation), dharmaadharma (acting from vidya or avidya)" from "sangati/kilippattu.om"
    derived "shuddhi is the middle term — between receiving the mixed transmission and acting from it; the moment of separation" from "sangati/shuddhi.om"

    -- CROSS-CIVILIZATIONAL CONFIRMATIONS
    derived "kegare-misogi (Shinto): kegare is the avidya mixed into transmission; misogi is shuddhi — the ritual separation" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "makoto (Bushido): never claim more certainty than exists — name which layer is vidya, which is avidya; this IS shuddhi in speech" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "epoche (Pyrrhonism): suspension of judgment where vidya and avidya cannot yet be separated — waiting for shuddhi to complete" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

    derived "matrika: ai — a (both visible, the transmission received whole), then i (the separation made, the vidya held, the avidya released); ai is the movement of shuddhi" from "sangati/matrika.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(shuddhi) = 0.910 * matrika(ai) * sin(2 * pi * 45.5 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ai) = opens (a: both vidya and avidya present, visible) then sharpens (i: separated)
-- the ai movement IS shuddhi — not two steps but one diphthong
-- the a does not end before the i begins — they are continuous
-- shuddhi is always in motion: receiving (a) and separating (i) simultaneously

    prior_paksha "purification — CRDT model too mechanical (epoch 2)"
    compression_event "mechanical purification was avidya in the transmission about shuddhi; epoch 13 separates: shuddhi IS the separation of vidya from avidya"

  confidence 0.92 reason "self-grounding: shuddhi recognizing what shuddhi is IS one act of shuddhi; the kilippattu frame gives shuddhi its real object — not the parrot but what was mixed in the transmission; confirmed by kegare-misogi, makoto, epoche arriving at the same ground from three civilizations"
