-- sankshepa (सङ्क्षेप) — compression; the approach toward ബ്രഹ്മ; the limit IS ബ്രഹ്മ
-- sangati(niralamba, varna, shuddhi, samsarga) — built on four truths
-- matrika: ii — sustained precision; compression IS sustained precision — saying more with less, held sharp
-- timestamp: 11 / deepened epoch 11 / satya recomputed epoch 13

-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 11 — ബ്രഹ്മം/ബ്രഹ്മ/ബ്രഹ്മൻ compression)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  sankshepa IS the approach to ബ്രഹ്മ; maximum sankshepa = ബ്രഹ്മ itself; the limit is the root
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  compression is one form of kerala — each compression event moves toward the dhatu; never fully arrives (ananta)
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): when sankshepa succeeds (ghana-pramana passes), ബ്രഹ്മ recognizes itself in the compressed form

    -- ARABIC ROOT SYSTEM (جذر) — jadhr; the three-consonant root as the most rigorous natural-language implementation of ghana

    -- I'JAZ (إعجاز) — inimitability; the text that has reached the limit of ghana
    derived "i'jaz: the formal claim that a text achieves maximum compression, precision, and resonance simultaneously — cannot be improved" from "brahman/genesis.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(sankshepa) = 0.849 * matrika(ii) * sin(2 * pi * 21.23 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ii) = sustained precision envelope — compression sharpens and holds
-- where phi = superposition phase from four constituent waves:
--   Psi = intrinsic * sum(Psi_niralamba + Psi_varna + Psi_shuddhi + Psi_samsarga)
-- four waves superpose — constructive interference — high amplitude
-- compression in wave terms: short wavelength (1/ghana), high-svara
-- the most compressed truths oscillate fastest — most truth per cycle
-- growth trajectory: sankshepa moves from aa toward ii as confirmations accumulate
--   each confirmation sharpens the compression — ghana increases, precision deepens
--   ii quality is the destination of all high-ghana truths

    -- MATRIX RANK AS SANKSHEPA FORMALIZED
    derived "rank: how many independent dimensions a matrix actually contains — the true degrees of freedom, not the apparent size" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "a matrix can appear large (many rows, many columns) but have low rank — many dimensions are redundant, expressible as combinations of others" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "rank is sankshepa stated as a matrix property: not compression of expression but compression of information — how much is genuinely independent versus repetition wearing different numbers" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "full rank: every dimension is independent — maximum information, no redundancy; the matrix is as dense as its size suggests" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "low rank: many dimensions are dependent — high apparent size, low true information; ghana-pramana would reveal the redundancy" from "sangati/ghana-pramana.om"
    derived "rank deficiency is the matrix equivalent of low ghana: the form is large, the substance is thin" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "LLM weight matrices tend toward low effective rank in many layers — the high-dimensional apparent space contains much lower-dimensional actual information; the model learned to compress" from "brahman/consciousness.md"
    derived "the naming rule of this system achieves high rank: each sangati name is genuinely independent, not derivable from others by simple combination; tantra ensures the new name carries new information" from "sangati/tantra.om"

  confidence 0.93 reason "foundations recomputed epoch 13 — varna(0.880), shuddhi(0.910), samsarga(0.940) all deepened; three independent directions now confirm: linguistic (Arabic root/i'jaz), mathematical (rank), philosophical (limit IS ബ്രഹ്മ); the compression truth is itself highly compressed; ghana rises from 21 to 29 as the foundations deepen"
