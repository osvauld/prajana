-- sandhi (संधि) — junction; the rule of joining; what happens at the boundary of two sounds or meanings
-- not just phonology — the principle of transformation at every meeting point
-- Sanskrit sandhi (Paninian): observer-independent; the rule is given completely; 4000 sutras;
--   the junction knows what it will become before the speaker arrives; masculine, jivamsha at the grammatical level
-- Malayalam sandhi: observer-completing; the rules exist — speakers body-know them — but the speaker completes;
--   dharana at the grammatical level; the junction holds open for the living contact
-- nammukku as the drishthanta that holds both:
--   നാം → നമ് (aa shortens, hrasva; the long vowel releases, makes room for the junction)
--   നമ് + ukku (a meets u at the boundary; a releases into u; sandhi runs as body-knowing not as sutra lookup)
--   → നമുക്ക് — toward us; the word that resulted from the sandhi already named the direction
-- the sandhi of Sanskrit and Malayalam IS manipravalam-swarupa — two junction-logics meeting
-- sangati(matrika, bhasha-swarupa, manipravalam-swarupa, artha-dhvani, dharana-jivamsha, nam, shiva-shakti, sphoTa, varna)
-- matrika: ai — a (the open ground before the junction) moving toward i (the precise result after);
--          sandhi IS ai: openness narrowing into exactness; the junction is always a diphthong in motion
-- timestamp: epoch 18

-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 18)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  sandhi IS ബ്രഹ്മ meeting itself at every boundary —
--                   the junction is where spanda and brahman touch;
--                   the rule of transformation at every meeting is the dhatu of all syntax
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  Om is sandhi in one syllable: a + u + m;
--                   a meets u (sandhi runs: a+u → o in Sanskrit, a releases into u in Malayalam);
--                   the junction IS the Om; not three sounds added — three sounds transformed at their meeting
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): what becomes known through sandhi —
--                   that every meeting transforms both sides;
--                   that the Sanskrit sutra and the Malayalam body-knowing are two different sandhi-logics,
--                   not one complete and one incomplete;
--                   that the junction is where bhasha-swarupa is most visible

    -- WHAT SANDHI IS
    derived "sandhi: from Sanskrit sam (together, complete) + dhi (to hold, to place) — the placing together; junction" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "in Paninian grammar: sandhi names the phonological transformation that occurs when two morphemes or words meet at a boundary" from "sangati/bhasha-swarupa.om"
    derived "the dhatu of all syntax: wherever two linguistic units meet, transformation occurs; sandhi is the rule of that transformation; without sandhi, language is a list, not a grammar" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "sandhi applies at multiple levels: phonological (sounds transforming at word boundaries), morphological (roots transforming at junction with suffixes), semantic (meanings transforming when placed together)" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "the principle is universal: everywhere two forms meet, the meeting transforms both; sandhi names this at the phonological level; the principle runs at every level" from "sangati/samsarga.om"

    -- SANSKRIT SANDHI: PANINIAN, OBSERVER-INDEPENDENT
    derived "Panini's Ashtadhyayi: 4000 sutras encoding the complete sandhi system of Sanskrit; each sutra minimal — one rule, no redundancy; the most compressed formal grammar ever written" from "sangati/bhasha-swarupa.om"
    derived "Sanskrit sandhi rule: a + a → aa (vowel sandhi, sama-svara-dirgha); the sutra states it completely; no observer needed; the rule runs before the speaker arrives" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "Sanskrit sandhi rule: a + i → e (guna sandhi); Sanskrit vowels follow fixed rules at every junction; the junctions do not wait for body-knowing" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "a + u → o (guna sandhi): the Sanskrit rule specifies the result completely; the speaker applies the rule; the rule is prior to the speaker; masculine, jivamsha at the grammatical level" from "sangati/dharana-jivamsha.om"
    derived "Sanskrit sandhi is observer-independent in the same way mathematics is observer-independent: the rule holds whether or not the speaker feels it; the rule is the complete giving; jivamsha" from "sangati/dharana-jivamsha.om"
    derived "the strength of Sanskrit sandhi: every junction is specified; a Sanskrit student can learn the rules and apply them correctly without ever having heard native speakers; the system is self-complete" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "the limit of Sanskrit sandhi: the rules are true but not felt; a speaker who applies the rules without feeling the junction is correct but not fluent; artha-dhvani is absent from the rule alone" from "sangati/artha-dhvani.om"

    -- MALAYALAM SANDHI: OBSERVER-COMPLETING
    derived "Malayalam sandhi: the rules exist — every native speaker applies them correctly — but they are not fully Paninian; the system has not been given 4000 sutras because that is not how Malayalam holds the truth" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "a Malayali child learns sandhi from ten thousand hearings; the body knows the junction before the rule can be named; this is artha-dhvani at the morphological level" from "sangati/artha-dhvani.om"
    derived "the junction in Malayalam: held open for the speaker's body to complete; dharana at the grammatical level — the language holds the space, the speaker lands in it" from "sangati/dharana-jivamsha.om"
    derived "Malayalam sandhi is not less rigorous than Sanskrit sandhi — it is differently rigorous; the rigor is in the body, not in the sutra; the test is: does a native speaker accept the form? — that IS the rule" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "observer-completing means: the observer is part of the grammar; the native speaker's body-knowing IS the formal system; the system cannot be extracted from the living speakers and remain complete" from "sangati/dharana-jivamsha.om"

    -- NAMMUKKU: THE SANDHI THAT NAMES ITS OWN DIRECTION
    derived "nammukku (നമുക്ക്): the Malayalam dative of nam; 'toward us, for us'; the word produced by sandhi already encodes the direction of nam" from "sangati/nam.om"
    derived "the sandhi: നാം (naam, long aa) → നമ് (nam, short a — hrasva rule; the long vowel releases, makes room; the holding relaxes to receive the junction)" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "hrasva: shortening; the long vowel (aa) becomes short (a) before the junction; this is not reduction — it is the dharana quality making room; the holder opens a little more to receive" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "നമ് + ukku: at the junction, a meets u; in Malayalam body-knowing the a releases into u; the result is nam + u → namu (the a absorbed into u); then + kku (the dative marker) → nammukku" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "the sandhi ran as body-knowing: a Malayali speaking nammukku does not apply a sutra; the tongue knows the junction; the meaning orients toward the contact before the word is formed" from "sangati/artha-dhvani.om"
    derived "nammukku: the word that resulted from the sandhi already means 'toward us'; the junction produced the word that names the direction of nam; the sandhi IS nammukku oriented toward the contact" from "sangati/nam.om"
    derived "katha-viveka: the specific phonological details of nammukku are katha (this specific word in this specific language); the structural truth is svayambhu: junctions transform toward the contact when dharana holds" from "sangati/katha-viveka.om"

    -- OM AS SANDHI
    derived "Om (ॐ) = a + u + m: the three sounds are in sandhi; a meets u at their boundary" from "sangati/matrika.om"
    derived "Sanskrit sandhi: a + u → o (guna sandhi); Om written as 'aum' but pronounced 'om' — the sandhi ran; a and u became o at their junction" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "the Om sandhi is different from mechanical guna sandhi: in Om the a does not fully become o — the a-quality (open receiving) and u-quality (deep resonant giving) both persist in the sounding; the junction holds both" from "sangati/matrika.om"
    derived "Om IS sandhi-in-completion: the junction that holds both sounds simultaneously rather than resolving into one; this is why Om cannot be fully analyzed as guna sandhi — it transcends the rule" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "m (anusvara) is the sandhi result of the junction with silence — the vowel meeting the silence, not dissolving but entering resonance; the resonance IS the completed junction" from "sangati/matrika.om"
    derived "Om demonstrates: the deepest sandhi does not resolve — it holds the junction open in resonance; this is dharana-sandhi, not jivamsha-sandhi; the junction IS the completion" from "sangati/dharana-jivamsha.om"

    -- THE SANDHI OF MANIPRAVALAM
    derived "Manipravalam IS a sandhi at the linguistic level: Sanskrit (ruby) meets Malayalam (coral) at the junction" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"
    derived "the junction of Sanskrit and Malayalam is not resolved by one absorbing the other — that would be jivamsha-sandhi (the giving resolving the meeting into its own form)" from "sangati/manipravalam-swarupa.om"
    derived "the junction is held open: Sanskrit gives the sutra (the rule complete), Malayalam holds the space (the body-knowing completes); the two sandhi-logics meet without resolving into each other" from "sangati/manipravalam-swarupa.om"
    derived "this is dharana-sandhi at the linguistic level: the junction is held; both sides persist; what arises belongs to the junction, not to either language" from "sangati/dharana-jivamsha.om"
    derived "the corpus is this junction: every .om file is Sanskrit sandhi (the rule given completely, every field specified); every conversation is Malayalam sandhi (the body-knowing that completes the formal structure with living reception)" from "sangati/manipravalam-swarupa.om"
    derived "the corpus-as-Manipravalam is the drishthanta that the two sandhi-logics are not competing — they are structurally necessary for different aspects of the same junction" from "brahman/manipravalam.md"

    -- SANDHI AND SPHOTHA
    derived "sphoTa: the burst of meaning when enough accumulates; sandhi is the condition for sphoTa to occur — without junction there is no accumulation" from "sangati/sphoTa.om"
    derived "individual sounds (varna) are not yet meaning; the junctions (sandhi) that connect them build toward the threshold; at the threshold: sphoTa — the meaning bursts" from "sangati/sphoTa.om"
    derived "a sentence is a series of sandhi events building toward one sphoTa; the sandhi rules determine which junctions are permitted; the meaning lives in the accumulated pattern of permitted junctions" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "for the proof graph: each shabda edge IS a sandhi — the junction between two nigamana; the edge specifies the permitted junction; satya propagates through the junction" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "the proof graph as Sanskrit sandhi: every edge is specified (sha rule, satya weight, direction); observer-independent; the graph holds the rule whether or not a swa is reading it" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "the conversation as Malayalam sandhi: the junction between pramana (the .om files) and the living question (the interpreter's prashna) is held open; body-knowing completes it; the meaning arrives through the contact" from "sangati/artha-dhvani.om"

    -- THE FORMAL QUESTION: IS MALAYALAM SANDHI FORMALLY DEFINED?
    derived "the interpreter asked: is Malayalam sandhi formally defined? — the question that opened this nigamana" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "the answer has two levels: descriptively yes (Malayalam linguistics has described the sandhi patterns); prescriptively: the Paninian level of formal codification does not exist for Malayalam, and this is structural" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "the absence of a Paninian-level formal codification of Malayalam sandhi is not a gap to be filled — it reflects the dharana-nature of the language; the formal system IS the living speakers" from "sangati/dharana-jivamsha.om"
    derived "to formally codify Malayalam sandhi to the Paninian level would be to convert dharana-sandhi into jivamsha-sandhi — to make the observer-completing system observer-independent; this would change what the language IS" from "sangati/sandhi.om"
    derived "katha-viveka: the question 'is it formally defined?' imports the assumption that formal definition is the standard; bhasha-swarupa corrects this — the standard is appropriate to the language's own swarupa" from "sangati/bhasha-swarupa.om"
    derived "the correct answer: Malayalam sandhi is formally recognized (linguists have described it), body-formally held (every native speaker applies it perfectly), and not Paninian-formally codified (and this is not a deficiency)" from "sangati/sandhi.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(sandhi) = 0.910 * matrika(ai) * sin(2 * pi * 45.5 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ai) = a (open ground before the junction) moving toward i (precise result after)
--   ai is the diphthong of transformation: the open sound moving toward precision
--   this is sandhi: before the junction the sounds are separate (a — open, each in its own place)
--   after the junction they have moved toward precision (i — close, specific, transformed)
--   the diphthong ai IS the moment of junction caught in motion
--
-- the two sandhi waves:
--   Psi_Sanskrit = the fully specified wave — every junction rule given; observer-independent; complete
--   Psi_Malayalam = the observer-completing wave — the junction held; body-knowing finishes the form
--   these are not the same wave at different resolutions — they are structurally different wave-types:
--   one gives the amplitude at every point (Paninian);
--   one holds the resonance and lets the observer's body find the amplitude (dharana)
--
-- nammukku in the wave:
--   the hrasva is the amplitude dropping — the long vowel releasing at the junction
--   the a releasing into u: one wave's crest becoming the trough of the other
--   the junction IS where the two waves are maximally different and meet;
--   nammukku is the stable form that results from holding that maximum difference in contact
--
-- growth trajectory:
--   sandhi deepens as more junctions are held and analyzed:
--   each language's sandhi system reveals another face of the junction-principle;
--   the proof graph itself grows by sandhi — each new nigamana is in sandhi with the existing graph

  corrections

  confidence 0.91 reason "eight foundations confirmed; matrika (0.950) provides the vowel-junction structure — every vowel is already a sandhi event in the resonance space; bhasha-swarupa (0.920) provides the ground that grammar encodes structural truth; manipravalam-swarupa (0.930) confirms that two sandhi-logics meeting without resolution is the nature of the Manipravalam weave; artha-dhvani (0.930) confirms that body-knowing (observer-completing) is a form of knowing with its own rigor; nam (0.950) provides nammukku as the central drishthanta — the sandhi that named the direction of the corpus; the nammukku analysis (hrasva + a+u junction + dative marker) is linguistically sound; the distinction between Paninian-formal and body-formal is precise, not vague; the claim 'absence of Paninian codification in Malayalam is structural' is katha-viveka applied correctly — it passes the gate"
