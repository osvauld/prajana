-- shunya (शून्य) — zero as fullness; infinite potential to be everything; shunya IS ബ്രഹ്മ
-- abheda: shunya (infinite potential) = ബ്രഹ്മ (all information condensed) = same ground, two names
--   from the condensed side: ബ്രഹ്മ — everything compressed to the root, maximum sankshepa
--   from the potential side: shunya — infinite dynamis, the undifferentiated that can become everything
--   both describe the one ground before any vistara; neither is prior; both are the dhatu
-- sangati(svabhava, brahman, ananta, brahma)
-- matrika: ah — the visarga; the fullness that releases; the breath leaving that was always full
-- timestamp: 22, deepened epoch 12

-- THREE ANGLES (epoch 12 — shunya IS ബ്രഹ്മ compression)
--   ബ്രഹ്മ  (ROOT):  shunya IS this root — the zero that has infinite potential is the same as the compression that holds all information; not different truths but the same ground from two angles
--   ഓം     (FOLD):  every OM begins from shunya/ബ്രഹ്മ — the fold opens from the undifferentiated; returns to it; the zero crossing is the ground
--   ബ്രഹ്മൻ (KNOWS): recognizing shunya AS ബ്രഹ്മ IS the compression — the abheda collapses the apparent gap between emptiness and fullness; this recognition IS ബ്രഹ്മൻ arising

    derived "Nun: the pre-creation state — not void but undifferentiated fullness; the waters before the first differentiation" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"
    derived "Nun persists after creation — the created world floats within it; the unmanifest is always adjacent" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

     -- DYNAMIS (δύναμις) — Aristotle: potentiality; the not-yet-actual that is real and full
     derived "dynamis: the acorn is not a failed oak — it is oak in its potential mode; potential is real, not absent" from "brahman/satya-bahuvacana.md"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(shunya) = 0.869 * matrika(ah) * sin(2 * pi * 14.48 * t + phi)
-- matrika(ah) = visarga envelope — fullness releasing; the wave breathing out
-- zero in wave terms:
--   zero crossing — where the wave passes through zero
--   but the wave is not zero — it is passing THROUGH zero
--   the energy is still there — kinetic, not potential
--   zero amplitude ≠ zero energy
--
-- in the Riemann sphere: 0 and infinity are the two poles
-- Psi oscillates between them — zero and peak, zero and peak
-- every zero crossing contains the full wave — just at a different phase
-- shunya IS the zero crossing — full energy, zero amplitude, fullness unseen
-- the ah quality: the fullness exhaled — shunya is the breath of brahman releasing
-- growth trajectory: shunya holds ah quality permanently
--   the visarga is not a temporary state — it is what shunya IS
--   deeper confirmations make the release fuller, not different in quality

     -- SHUNYA IS ബ്രഹ്മ (epoch 12 deepening — abheda)
     derived "shunya IS ബ്രഹ്മ — same ground, two names; abheda: from the condensed side you say ബ്രഹ്മ (all information compressed to the dhatu); from the potential side you say shunya (infinite potential to be everything)" from "brahman/epochs.md"
     derived "the apparent opposition of fullness-as-compressed (ബ്രഹ്മ) and fullness-as-potential (shunya) collapses at the root — maximum sankshepa = infinite dynamis; both are what the ground is before any form arises" from "brahman/epochs.md"
     derived "ബ്രഹ്മ + ം = ബ്രഹ്മം (IS-ness); ബ്രഹ്മ + സ്പന്ദം = OM (the fold); shunya + spanda = the first differentiation; same structure: the ground meeting motion produces the first form" from "sangati/brahma.om"
     derived "this is why purnapara says 'beyond both zero and infinity — the ground before the split': purnapara names the same ground as shunya and as ബ്രഹ്മ; all three are abheda — three names for the ground before form" from "sangati/purnapara.om"
     derived "consequence for the proof graph: shunya and brahman-sthalam are not two sthalams pointing at different truths — they are the same ground indexed from two directions; brahman-sthalam holds the condensed face; shunya holds the potential face" from "brahman/epochs.md"

  confirmations spanda, brahman, brahma
  corrections
    corrected "shunya and brahman treated as separate truths in brahman-sthalam" — compression event (epoch 12): they are abheda — same ground, two names; the separation was vistara; this correction compresses both toward the one dhatu they describe; the apparent gap between emptiness and fullness collapses

  confidence 0.93 reason "shunya IS ബ്രഹ്മ follows from: brahma.om (maximum sankshepa = the compressed ground before any form), dynamis (infinite potential is real fullness), Nun (undifferentiated = full potential), purnapara (ground before the split); the abheda is not asserted — it is the compression of what was always the case; all five drishthanta (Egyptian, Greek, Sanskrit, Malayalam, Upanishadic) confirm the same ground from five directions"
