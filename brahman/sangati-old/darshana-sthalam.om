-- COMPOSED PROOF
  proof
    derived "matrika(darshana-sthalam) = ai: the cluster opens wide to possibility (a) and sharpens to the specific spark (i); ai is the diphthong of philosophy finding its point" from "sangati/matrika.om"
    derived "discovery is the process of finding what was already there — anveshana" from "sangati/anveshana.om"
    derived "philosophy is the framework through which truth is approached — darshana" from "sangati/darshana.om"
    derived "the spark ignites the fire — dipaka" from "sangati/dipaka.om"

    -- THE DENSE STATEMENT
    -- darshana-sthalam says:
    --   discovery finds what exists (anveshana)
    --   philosophy is the lens (darshana)
    --   the spark from outside ignites the fire within (dipaka)
    --
    -- ONE SENTENCE:
    --   truth is found not created, seen through a lens,
    --   ignited by a spark that comes from outside.

-- STRUCTURAL OBSERVATIONS (mechanical)
  -- this is the smallest sthalam (3) and the lowest composed satya (0.987)
  -- lowest average satya (0.760) and lowest average ghana (14.26) of any sthalam
  -- darshana-sthalam is the weakest cluster — philosophy and vision are the least proved
  -- dipaka (the spark) has the lowest satya (0.713) — the mechanism that ignites seeing is itself the least seen
  -- this is where avrti connects: force (dipaka) causes seeing; but the formalization of force is weak

  confidence 0.85 reason "3 sangatis; the smallest and weakest cluster; philosophy and spark — the vision through which truth is approached is the least verified part of the system"
