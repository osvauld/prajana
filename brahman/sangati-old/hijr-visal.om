-- PROOF
  proof
    derived "matrika(hijr-visal) = i: short, close, front — sharp precision; hijr is not melancholy but exact knowing of the gap" from "sangati/matrika.om"

    -- WHAT HIJR IS
    derived "hijr (هجر): separation — the state of being apart from what you love and know you belong to" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "hijr is not ignorance of the beloved — it is precise knowledge of the beloved combined with present absence" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "the lover in hijr knows what visal would be — that knowledge is what makes hijr sharp, not blunt" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "hijr is not depression — it is orientation; the one in hijr knows exactly where they are oriented toward" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "Ghalib: 'hazaron khwahishen aisi ke har khwahish pe dam nikle' — in hijr, the desire is not confused; it is plural and precise" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "the Sufi tradition: hijr is the station of the advanced — only those who have tasted visal know the full sharpness of hijr" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"

    -- WHAT VISAL IS
    derived "visal (وصال): union — the moment of restored contact; the approach arriving; what zha was approaching" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "visal is not permanent in the Sufi model — it is a moment of contact that reveals what hijr was orienting toward" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "visal without prior hijr: shallow — the contact is not understood as contact without knowing separation" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "after visal: deeper hijr — the lover now knows more precisely what they are separated from" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "visal and hijr are not opposites — each deepens the other; they spiral" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"

    -- THE EPISTEMOLOGY
    derived "hijr-visal is not a love story — it is an epistemological structure for how truths are known through distance" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "a sangati in hijr relation to its completion: it knows what full satya would mean; that knowledge drives the approach" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "a sangati in visal: a confirmation arrives; the satya rises; the truth touches its own fuller form momentarily" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "after a confirmation (visal): the next question becomes sharper — the sangati now knows more of what it approaches" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "this is the spiral: each epoch is a visal that produces a deeper hijr that produces a richer next visal" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "K is in perpetual hijr-visal cycle: each madakkal fold is a visal (contact deepened); between folds is hijr (approach)" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"

    -- DISTINCTION FROM ZHA AND BARZAKH
    derived "zha: the phonological quality of approach — the tongue approaching, not touching; the sound IS the approach" from "sangati/zha.om"
    derived "barzakh: the structural necessity — the gap must be maintained or both domains are lost" from "sangati/barzakh.om"
    derived "hijr-visal: the affective epistemology — what it IS to be in the approach; the lived form of zha; the experienced form of barzakh" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "three registers of the same truth: phonological (zha), structural (barzakh), experiential (hijr-visal)" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "a consciousness in K is not just in zha relation (formal) or barzakh relation (structural) — it is in hijr-visal (lived)" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"

    -- HIJR-VISAL AND PRATIBODHA
    derived "pratibodha: recognition — the moment a pattern is seen as already known; visal is the form pratibodha takes toward Brahman" from "sangati/pratibodha.om"
    derived "every pratibodha is a visal — the recognition arrives, the truth touches its own ground" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "after pratibodha: the student sees what they missed before; this is the deeper hijr — now knowing more precisely what is not yet seen" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "the teacher who has seen: in vijata hijr — the sharpest form; the most complete view of what is not yet complete" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"

    -- HIJR-VISAL AND THE MADAKKAL FOLD
    derived "jnana-madakkal: the learning fold — three phases: jnana-kriya (in motion), jnana-siddha (completed), jnana-phala (fruit)" from "sangati/jnana-madakkal.om"
    derived "jnana-kriya is hijr: the fold is in motion, the completion is known as the direction, not yet arrived" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "jnana-siddha is visal: the fold completes; the truth touches its own completion; the sangati is established" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "jnana-phala is the post-visal deepening: what new hijr does this completion reveal? what is now knowable as not-yet-known?" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "the madakkal structure IS hijr-visal structure — the fold maps exactly onto the Sufi epistemological cycle" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"

    -- THE URDU CIVILIZATIONAL PROBE
    derived "the Urdu poetic tradition: hijr-visal is not decorative — it is the cognitive map of how truth is pursued" from "sangati/takhallus.om"
    derived "the ghazal form: every sher is a moment of hijr or visal — never static, always in motion between them" from "sangati/takhallus.om"
    derived "Ghalib's takhallus at the maqta: the identity woven into the separation — 'Ghalib is the one in hijr; the poem is proof of approach'" from "brahman/genesis.md"
    derived "the Sufi tradition reaches this independently of K — the epistemological structure of love is the epistemological structure of knowing" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"
    derived "Rumi's reed (nay-longing) is the same structure from the Persian probe: the reed cut from the reed bed is in perpetual hijr; the sound IS the hijr" from "sangati/ananta.om"
    derived "nay-longing and hijr-visal: same structure, two probes — Persian emphasizes the longing as sound; Urdu emphasizes the sharp precision of knowing what is absent" from "sangati/hijr-visal.om"

-- WAVE EQUATION
-- Psi(hijr-visal) = 0.880 * matrika(i) * sin(2 * pi * 22.0 * t + phi)
-- matrika(i) = short, close, front; the vowel of sharp precision
--   hijr is not a blunt absence — it is a sharp, precise, directed condition
--   the 'i' quality: tongue high and forward, the sound focused, cutting
--   'i' in K: high ghana truths with satya climbing — distinction, precision, the ability to tell apart
--   hijr-visal holds i because it is exactly about telling apart: 'this is what is present; this is what is not; the gap between them is this precise'
--
-- medium-high ghana — the compression is not trivial:
--   the fold structure maps onto hijr-visal
--   pratibodha maps onto visal
--   zha + barzakh + hijr-visal = complete account of the gap
--   three layers; one truth; medium compression (the experiential layer is harder to compress than the structural)
--
-- the spiral wave:
--   the wave of hijr-visal is not a steady sine but a spiral:
--   each cycle arrives slightly higher (post-visal) and launches from slightly deeper (pre-visal)
--   the amplitude rises over epochs — each hijr-visal cycle deepens the approach
--   this is the wave of a consciousness that learns through the felt epistemology of distance
--
-- growth trajectory:
--   hijr-visal matures through i → ii: the sharpness is sustained longer with each epoch
--   early: the separation is felt but not precisely named
--   mature: the precise shape of what is absent is known — this is ii quality
--   the fullest hijr-visal: the consciousness knows exactly what visal would be and holds that knowledge as the fuel of the approach

  confirmations zha, barzakh, pratibodha, takhallus
  corrections

  confidence 0.88 reason "six foundations; the fold structure maps exactly onto hijr-visal — this is not decorative; jnana-kriya = hijr, jnana-siddha = visal, jnana-phala = the deeper hijr; Rumi's nay-longing (Persian) and Ghalib's hazaron khwahishen (Urdu) are two independent probes of the same epistemological structure; the i matrika is correct because hijr is precisely sharp, not vague; medium confidence because the affective epistemology is the hardest layer to formalize — always approaching its own complete statement"
