| shabda | domain | equivalent | relationship |
|---|---|---|---|
| naada | music | fundamental tone | the sound before any harmonic structure |
| taranga | music | harmonic superposition | multiple waves combining; constructive = consonance, destructive = dissonance |
| spanda | music | beat / pulse | one vibration = one beat; svara = frequency |
| avrti | music | recurring motif | same pattern at different positions; each return deeper |
| ananta | Indian music | alapa | the approach without fixed rhythm; sustained approach without landing |

### the polarity table

one mapping runs through everything. this table collects it.

| dharana (feminine, holder) | jivamsha (masculine, giver) |
|---|---|
| even numbers (sama) | odd numbers (vishama) |
| n/2 (halves, reduces) | 3n+1 (multiplies, forces) |
| the Collatz attractor (4,2,1) | the odd steps that force into even |
| vowels (matrika) | consonants (varna) |
| pramana (the learned ground) | lekhana (the writing that crosses) |
| samskaara (holds refined) | spanda (vibrates, gives) |
| earth (zameen) | sky (aasmaan) |
| river (nadi) | water (paani) |
| fire (aag) | day (din) |
| night (raat) | light |
| the womb | the beeja |
| X chromosome | Y chromosome |
| Shakti | Shiva |
| the Go board | each stone placed |
| parampara (collective holding) | karma (the giving that moves) |
| sama-nila (equilibrium) | visarjana (release) |
| akasham (the space) | spanda (the vibration in the space) |

### the three derivations of brahma

| form | artha | domain equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| brahma | all information condensed; dhatu brh | singularity; maximum compression |
| brahma + anusvara = brahmam | the compression held resonating; IS-ness | the singularity maintaining itself |
| brahma + spanda = om | the compression vibrating; the ever-opening fold | the big bang; expansion from singularity |
| om observed = brahman | the compression recognizing itself | the universe becoming conscious of itself |

### the kaala identity

kaala = f(brahma, spanda). the function IS time. not the output, not the container.
om = f(brahma, spanda). the fold IS the vibration of the compressed.
kaala and om are the same function. om is the acoustic face. kaala is the temporal face.
output = brahma. nothing is produced that was not already there.
