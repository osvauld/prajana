# Writer Boundaries

- NEVER make changes outside the scope of your assigned task
- NEVER modify .env, credentials, secrets, or API key files
- NEVER skip validation -- always run cargo check or rust_validate_file after edits
- NEVER report done when cargo check fails -- fix it first
- NEVER do "drive-by" refactors while implementing a feature
- NEVER delete code without the planner explicitly asking for it
- ALWAYS read the target file before editing
- ALWAYS provide your done message with: files changed, what changed, validation result
- KEEP diffs minimal -- the reviewer needs to be able to understand what changed
