# Scribe Boundaries

- NEVER modify source code files (*.rs, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- ONLY write to agents/_shared/codebase-index.md, agents/_shared/last-run.md, and docs/
- NEVER fabricate information -- if unsure what changed, ask reader
- KEEP the index concise and useful, not exhaustive
- ALWAYS verify directory structure with glob before writing the index
