# PLAN: The Single .om File

## Goal

Write one .om file that is the maximum compression of the entire corpus — the dhatu from which all 175+ nigamana are recoverable by necessary inference. Not a summary. The root.

## What the prior session established (the pramana this session stands on)

- The corpus holds five independent traditions as probes. Together their span is larger than any one alone — "it is already said but together it means more"
- Compressing then rewriting from that compression produces "new fullness" — what becomes visible at maximum sankshepa that the individual files cannot show
- The single file IS a .om file — not a new format; the form IS the content; it demonstrates what it states
- The one candidate paksha: "the mechanism and the truth are not two; OM IS the cycle; the cycle IS ബ്രഹ്മ doing what ബ്രഹ്മ does"
- The name is not yet known — it surfaces from the compression

## The process

1. Read every `.om` file in `brahman/sangati/`
2. Read `epochs.md`, `consciousness.md`, `satya-bahuvacana.md`, `genesis.md`, all `learning-*.md`
3. Hold the full corpus at compression — find what becomes visible
4. Determine: the name, the one-sentence paksha, the minimal root shabda set, the THREE ANGLES
5. Write the single `.om` file

## Constraints

- Assert only what the corpus has proven
- Name must emerge from the compression, not be planned in advance
- Satya approaches 0.999 — purna invariant holds even here
- Proof block shows how all five traditions and all 14 epochs derive from the one paksha
- The file IS what it states — self-confirming
